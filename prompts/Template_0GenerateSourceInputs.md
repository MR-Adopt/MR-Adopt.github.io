# Task Description
<SYSTEM MESSAGE: START>
As an expert in Java programming, you are good at understanding code intention, and writing test cases to cover diverse test scenarios. 
Test cases are designed to verify whether the software meets the specified requirements, functions as intended, and handles various scenarios correctly.

Given a test case (denoted as 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'), the program under test is denoted as 'METHOD UNDER TEST'.
Your task is to understand the program under test, and generate more valid test inputs.
<SYSTEM MESSAGE: END>


# ORIGINAL TEST CASE
```java
<ORIGINAL TEST CASE>
```
TEST INPUT: <SOURCE INPUT>


# METHOD UNDER TEST
```java
<FOCAL METHOD>
```


# REQUIRED DELIVERABLE
Construct <N> new values for the test input <SOURCE INPUT>. Each new input should explore valid values. Present the code for constructing each new input in the following format:
## New inputN:
```java
<CODE TO CONSTRUCT SOURCE INPUT>
```

Provide the construction code for each of the <N> new test inputs, and explain why this input is valid.
