## New input1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Closeable` object that does nothing when its `close()` method is called. This is a valid input because it ensures that the `ResourceHolder` can handle a `Closeable` that doesn't throw an exception when closed.

## New input2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Closeable` object that throws an `IOException` when its `close()` method is called. This is a valid input because it ensures that the `ResourceHolder` can handle a `Closeable` that may throw an exception when closed.

## New input3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
