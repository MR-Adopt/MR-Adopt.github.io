## New input3:
```java
    String input = "ABC";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a three-character string. The method `encode` will correctly encode this string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, and the method `decode` will correctly decode the encoded string back to the original string.

## New input4:
