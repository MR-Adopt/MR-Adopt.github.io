## New input1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value of 0 seconds. This is a boundary case as it is the smallest possible value for a `Cost` object.

## New input2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value equal to the maximum integer value. This is a boundary case as it is the largest possible value for a `Cost` object.

## New input3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value of -1 seconds. This is a boundary case as it is the smallest possible negative value for a `Cost` object.

## New input4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value equal to the minimum integer value. This is a boundary case as it is the smallest possible value for a `Cost` object.

## New input5:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value of 5 seconds. This is a typical case as it is a valid value for a `Cost` object.
