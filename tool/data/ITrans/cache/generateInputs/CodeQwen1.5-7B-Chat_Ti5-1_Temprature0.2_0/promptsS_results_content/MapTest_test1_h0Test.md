## New input1:
```java
    v01.put("123", 456);
    v01.put("12x", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" and "12x" from 123 to 456. This change in value does not violate the original requirements of the test case.

## New input2:
```java
    v01.put("123", 789);
    v01.put("12x", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" and "12x" from 123 to 789. This change in value does not violate the original requirements of the test case.

## New input3:
```java
    v01.put("123", 0);
    v01.put("12x", 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" and "12x" from 123 to 0. This change in value does not violate the original requirements of the test case.

## New input4:
```java
    v01.put("123", -123);
    v01.put("12x", -123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" and "12x" from 123 to -123. This change in value does not violate the original requirements of the test case.

## New input5:
```java
    v01.put("123", null);
    v01.put("12x", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" and "12x" from 123 to null. This change in value does not violate the original requirements of the test case.
