```java
    int year = Year.now().getValue();
    int half = 1;
```

## New input2:
```java
    int year = Year.now().getValue();
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input uses the current year as the year value and sets the half-of-year to 2. This is valid because the year is a valid year value and half-of-year 2 is a valid half-of-year.

## New input3:
```java
    int year = Year.now().getValue() + 1;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: This input uses the next year as the year value and sets the half-of-year to 1. This is valid because the year is a valid year value and half-of-year 1 is a valid half-of-year.

## New input4:
```java
    int year = Year.now().getValue() + 1;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input uses the next year as the year value and sets the half-of-year to 2. This is valid because the year is a valid year value and half-of-year 2 is a valid half-of-year.

## New input5:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: This input uses the minimum year value as the year value and sets the half-of-year to 1. This is valid because the year is a valid year value and half-of-year 1 is a valid half-of-year.
