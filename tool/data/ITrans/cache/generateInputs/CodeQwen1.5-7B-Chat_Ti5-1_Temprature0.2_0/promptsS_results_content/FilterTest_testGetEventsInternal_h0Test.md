## New input1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional `FilterEventMock` object in the `filter`. Adding a new event to the filter changes the internal state, thus making it a valid and boundary-case input.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a `null` object in the `filter`. Adding a `null` object to the filter is valid, as it does not change the internal state. However, it is a boundary-case input because it deviates from the typical usage of the method under test.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input includes a duplicate `FilterEventMock` object in the `filter`. Adding a duplicate event to the filter does not change the internal state, thus making it a valid and boundary-case input.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
    filter.add(null);
```
Explanation: This input includes both a new event and a `null` object in the `filter`. Adding both a new event and a `null` object to the filter is valid, as it does not change the internal state. However, it is a boundary-case input because it deviates from the typical usage of the method under test.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
```
Explanation: This input includes both a duplicate event and a new event in the `filter`. Adding both a duplicate event and a new event to the filter does not change the internal state, thus making it a valid and boundary-case input.
