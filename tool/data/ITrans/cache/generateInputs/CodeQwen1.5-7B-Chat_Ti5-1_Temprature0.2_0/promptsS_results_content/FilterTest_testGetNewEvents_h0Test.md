## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with a unique event name, date, and category. This ensures that the event is not a duplicate of the original event and that the filter can correctly identify new events.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "2022-12-31", "Category2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with a unique event name, date, and category. This ensures that the event is not a duplicate of the original event and that the filter can correctly identify new events.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with the same event name, date, and category as the original event. This ensures that the filter can correctly identify the original event as a new event.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with the same event name, date, and category as the original event and adds it to the filter. This ensures that the filter can correctly identify the original event as a new event.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with the same event name, date, and category as the original event and adds it to the filter twice. This ensures that the filter can correctly identify the original event as a new event.
