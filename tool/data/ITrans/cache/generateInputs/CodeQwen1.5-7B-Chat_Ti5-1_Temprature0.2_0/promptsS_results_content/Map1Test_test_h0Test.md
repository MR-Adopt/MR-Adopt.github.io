## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "456" and the value is "def". This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "xyz");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123". The new value is "xyz". This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair and that the value associated with the key "123" is different from the original value "abc".

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", "ghi");
    v01.put("123", "jkl");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map and changes the value associated with the key "123". The new key is "789" and the new value is "ghi". The original key "123" is still associated with the value "abc". This ensures that the map contains at least two key-value pairs.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "mno");
    v01.put("456", "pqr");
    v01.put("789", "stu");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds three new key-value pairs to the map. The keys are "123", "456", and "789", and the corresponding values are "mno", "pqr", and "stu". This ensures that the map contains at least three key-value pairs.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "vwx");
    v01.put("456", "yza");
    v01.put("789", "bcd");
    v01.put("101112", "efg");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds four new key-value pairs to the map. The keys are "123", "456", "789", and "101112", and the corresponding values are "vwx", "yza", "bcd", and "efg". This ensures that the map contains at least four key-value pairs.
