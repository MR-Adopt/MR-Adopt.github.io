## New input1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year 0 is a leap year according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules. The method `isLeapYear()` checks if the year is divisible by 4 without remainder, and year 0 is divisible by 4.

## New input2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year 1000 is not a leap year according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules. The method `isLeapYear()` checks if the year is divisible by 4 without remainder, and year 1000 is not divisible by 4.

## New input3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 4000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year 4000 is a leap year according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules. The method `isLeapYear()` checks if the year is divisible by 4 without remainder, and year 4000 is divisible by 4.

## New input4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 5000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year 5000 is not a leap year according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules. The method `isLeapYear()` checks if the year is divisible by 4 without remainder, and year 5000 is not divisible by 4.

## New input5:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = -1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year -1 is not a leap year according to the ISO proleptic calendar system rules. The method `isLeapYear()` checks if the year is divisible by 4 without remainder, and year -1 is not divisible by 4.
