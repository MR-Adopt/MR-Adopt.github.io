## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts any string value within the range "0" - "7". The deviceBus is set to "0", which is a valid I2C bus number.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts any string value within the range "0" - "7". The deviceBus is set to "7", which is a valid I2C bus number.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `setDeviceBus` method does not accept any string value outside the range "0" - "7". The deviceBus is set to "8", which is not a valid I2C bus number.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `setDeviceBus` method does not accept an empty string. The deviceBus is set to "", which is not a valid I2C bus number.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "a";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `setDeviceBus` method does not accept any string value that is not a number. The deviceBus is set to "a", which is not a valid I2C bus number.
