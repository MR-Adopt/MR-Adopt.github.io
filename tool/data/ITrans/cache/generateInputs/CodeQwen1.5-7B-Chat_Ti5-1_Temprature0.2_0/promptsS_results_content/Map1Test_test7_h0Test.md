## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(0));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(0));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with the same key "101" and "102" but with different values. This is a common scenario in real-world data and can be useful for testing the program's handling of duplicate keys.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MAX_VALUE));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with different keys "101" and "102" and values that are the maximum and minimum possible values for a `BigInteger`. This is a common scenario in real-world data and can be useful for testing the program's handling of large numbers.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(-1));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(1));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with different keys "101" and "102" and values that are negative and positive. This is a common scenario in real-world data and can be useful for testing the program's handling of negative numbers.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MIN_VALUE));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with different keys "101" and "102" and values that are the maximum and minimum possible values for an `int`. This is a common scenario in real-world data and can be useful for testing the program's handling of integer values.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(999999999999999999L));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(1000000000000000000L));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with different keys "101" and "102" and values that are very large numbers. This is a common scenario in real-world data and can be useful for testing the program's handling of very large numbers.
