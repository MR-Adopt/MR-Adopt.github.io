## New input1:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a year that is a leap year and the first half of the year. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. Therefore, 2020 is a leap year. The first half of the year is from January 1 to June 30.

## New input2:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a year that is not a leap year and the second half of the year. A year is not a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. Therefore, 1900 is not a leap year. The second half of the year is from July 1 to December 31.

## New input3:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2100;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a year that is not a leap year and the first half of the year. A year is not a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. Therefore, 2100 is not a leap year. The first half of the year is from January 1 to June 30.

## New input4:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a year that is a leap year and the second half of the year. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. Therefore, 2000 is a leap year. The second half of the year is from July 1 to December 31.

## New input5:
```java
    int year1 = 1700;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1700;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a year that is not a leap year and the first half of the year. A year is not a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. Therefore, 1700 is not a leap year. The first half of the year is from January 1 to June 30.
