## New input1:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("", 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates an entry with an empty string as the key and an integer 0 as the value. This is a valid scenario for a map entry, as keys and values can be of any type and can include empty strings and zero.

## New input2:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("1234567890", 1234567890);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates an entry with a long string as the key and a long integer as the value. This is a valid scenario for a map entry, as keys and values can be of any type and can include long strings and long integers.

## New input3:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("null", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates an entry with the string "null" as the key and a null value. This is a valid scenario for a map entry, as keys and values can be of any type and can include null values.

## New input4:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("true", 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates an entry with the string "true" as the key and an integer 1 as the value. This is a valid scenario for a map entry, as keys and values can be of any type and can include boolean values.

## New input5:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("false", 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates an entry with the string "false" as the key and an integer 0 as the value. This is a valid scenario for a map entry, as keys and values can be of any type and can include boolean values.
