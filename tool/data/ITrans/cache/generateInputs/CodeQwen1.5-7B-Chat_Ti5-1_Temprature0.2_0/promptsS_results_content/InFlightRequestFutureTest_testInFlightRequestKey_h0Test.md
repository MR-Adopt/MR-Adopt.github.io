## New input1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses the default values for the `partition` and `offset` fields, which are both 0. This is a common and expected scenario, and it ensures that the hash code is consistent across multiple instances of the same `InFlightRequestKey`.

## New input2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses the maximum possible values for the `partition` and `offset` fields, which are both `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This ensures that the hash code is consistent across multiple instances of the same `InFlightRequestKey`, and that it does not overflow or cause any other issues.

## New input3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses the minimum possible values for the `partition` and `offset` fields, which are both `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. This ensures that the hash code is consistent across multiple instances of the same `InFlightRequestKey`, and that it does not underflow or cause any other issues.

## New input4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses the default value for the `partition` field and the maximum possible value for the `offset` field. This ensures that the hash code is consistent across multiple instances of the same `InFlightRequestKey`, and that it does not overflow or cause any other issues.

## New input5:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses the maximum possible value for the `partition` field and the default value for the `offset` field. This ensures that the hash code is consistent across multiple instances of the same `InFlightRequestKey`, and that it does not overflow or cause any other issues.
