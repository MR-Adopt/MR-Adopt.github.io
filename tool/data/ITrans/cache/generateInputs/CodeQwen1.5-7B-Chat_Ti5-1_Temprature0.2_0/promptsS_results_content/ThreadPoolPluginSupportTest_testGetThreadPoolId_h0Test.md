## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor1 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test1", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test1") and different core and maximum pool size (10), keep-alive time (2000L), and time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS). The queue is also different (ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2)), and the thread factory and rejection policy are the same as the original executor.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor2 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test2", manager, 0, 0, 500L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test2") and different core and maximum pool size (0). The keep-alive time is set to 500L, time unit is TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, queue is a `LinkedBlockingQueue`, thread factory is `Thread::new`, and rejection policy is `ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy`.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor3 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test3", manager, 3, 5, 3000L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new PriorityBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test3") and different core and maximum pool size (3, 5). The keep-alive time is set to 3000L, time unit is TimeUnit.SECONDS, queue is a `PriorityBlockingQueue`, thread factory is `Thread::new`, and rejection policy is `ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy`.

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor4 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test4", manager, 1, 1, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test4") and different core and maximum pool size (1, 1). The keep-alive time is set to 0L, time unit is TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, queue is a `SynchronousQueue`, thread factory is `Thread::new`, and rejection policy is `ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy`.

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor5 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test5", manager, 8, 12, 1500L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new DelayQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.RejectedExecutionHandler() {
    @Override
    public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor executor) {
        // Custom handling for rejected tasks
    }
});
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test5") and different core and maximum pool size (8, 12). The keep-alive time is set to 1500L, time unit is TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, queue is a `DelayQueue`, thread factory is `Thread::new`, and rejection policy is a custom `RejectedExecutionHandler` that does not throw an exception for rejected tasks.
