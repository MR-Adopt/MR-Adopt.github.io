## New input1:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Integer.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Integer.class` is a valid class in Java. It represents the Integer class itself, not an instance of the Integer class. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Double.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Double.class` is a valid class in Java. It represents the Double class itself, not an instance of the Double class. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original test case.

## New input3:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Float.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Float.class` is a valid class in Java. It represents the Float class itself, not an instance of the Float class. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original test case.

## New input4:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Short.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Short.class` is a valid class in Java. It represents the Short class itself, not an instance of the Short class. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original test case.

## New input5:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Byte.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Byte.class` is a valid class in Java. It represents the Byte class itself, not an instance of the Byte class. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original test case.
