## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` requires a positive integer as the parameter. A value of 0 is not a valid input, as it would result in an `IllegalArgumentException`. Therefore, this input is a boundary case.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` requires a positive integer as the parameter. A value of 1 is a valid input, as it creates a pool with a single thread. Therefore, this input is a valid case.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` requires a positive integer as the parameter. A value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` is a valid input, as it creates a pool with the maximum possible number of threads. Therefore, this input is a valid case.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` requires a positive integer as the parameter. A value of -1 is not a valid input, as it would result in an `IllegalArgumentException`. Therefore, this input is an invalid case.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` requires a positive integer as the parameter. A value of 2 is a valid input, as it creates a pool with two threads. Therefore, this input is a valid case.
