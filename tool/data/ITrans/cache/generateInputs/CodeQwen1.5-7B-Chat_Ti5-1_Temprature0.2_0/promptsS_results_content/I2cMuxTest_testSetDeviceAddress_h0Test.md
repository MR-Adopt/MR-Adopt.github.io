## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7F";
```
Explanation: The device address "0x7F" is a valid I2C address as it falls within the range of "0x70" - "0x77". This input tests the boundary case where the device address is at the upper limit of the valid range.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
```
Explanation: The device address "0x00" is a valid I2C address as it falls within the range of "0x70" - "0x77". This input tests the boundary case where the device address is at the lower limit of the valid range.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0xFF";
```
Explanation: The device address "0xFF" is not a valid I2C address as it is outside the range of "0x70" - "0x77". This input tests the boundary case where the device address is beyond the valid range.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x71";
```
Explanation: The device address "0x71" is a valid I2C address as it falls within the range of "0x70" - "0x77". This input tests a typical valid device address.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x72";
```
Explanation: The device address "0x72" is a valid I2C address as it falls within the range of "0x70" - "0x77". This input tests a typical valid device address.
