## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map has a different structure and content than the original input.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from 123L to 456L. This ensures that the map has the same structure as the original input, but with a different value for one of the entries.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "789" and the value is 789L. This ensures that the map has a different structure and content than the original input.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
    v01.put("789", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds three new key-value pairs to the map. The keys are "123", "456", and "789", and the corresponding values are 123L, 456L, and 789L. This ensures that the map has a different structure and content than the original input.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an empty map. This ensures that the map has a different structure and content than the original input, as it does not contain any key-value pairs.
