## New input1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000000");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the earliest possible time in the day, which is 00:00:00.000000000. This is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible value for a LocalTime object.

## New input2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the latest possible time in the day, which is 23:59:59.999999999. This is a boundary case because it is the largest possible value for a LocalTime object.

## New input3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[0];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents an array of LocalTime objects with no elements. This is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible size for an array of LocalTime objects.

## New input4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[100];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents an array of LocalTime objects with 100 elements. This is a boundary case because it is the largest possible size for an array of LocalTime objects.

## New input5:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[1];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents an array of LocalTime objects with 1 element. This is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible size for an array of LocalTime objects.
