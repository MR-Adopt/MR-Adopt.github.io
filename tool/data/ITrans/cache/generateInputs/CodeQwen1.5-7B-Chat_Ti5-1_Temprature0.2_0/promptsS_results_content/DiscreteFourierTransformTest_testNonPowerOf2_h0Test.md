## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(1, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses a small dimension (1) and a uniform distribution of values (-2 to 4). The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a mathematical operation that transforms a signal from its time-domain representation to its frequency-domain representation. For a single element, the DFT will result in a constant value, which is the same as the input.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(16, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(16);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses a large dimension (16) and a uniform distribution of values (-2 to 4). The DFT is a linear operation, meaning that the output will be a linear combination of the input values. For a 16-element input, the DFT will result in a complex number for each element.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(2, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses a small dimension (2) and a uniform distribution of values (-2 to 4). The DFT is a linear operation, meaning that the output will be a linear combination of the input values. For a 2-element input, the DFT will result in a complex number for each element.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(32, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(32);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it uses a large dimension (32) and a uniform distribution of values (-2 to 4). The DFT is a linear operation, meaning that the output will be a complex number for each element. For a 32-element input, the DFT will result in a complex number for each element.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(0, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(0);
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because it uses a zero dimension. The Discrete Fourier Transform is not defined for zero-dimensional inputs.
