## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the `retryCount1` to 0, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will ensure that a new client is created for the specified storage account with the default retry count.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the `retryCount1` to 3, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will ensure that a new client is created for the specified storage account with a retry count of 3.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the `retryCount1` to 5, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will ensure that a new client is created for the specified storage account with a retry count of 5.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the `retryCount1` to 10, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will ensure that a new client is created for the specified storage account with a retry count of 10.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 100;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the `retryCount1` to 100, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will ensure that a new client is created for the specified storage account with a retry count of 100.
