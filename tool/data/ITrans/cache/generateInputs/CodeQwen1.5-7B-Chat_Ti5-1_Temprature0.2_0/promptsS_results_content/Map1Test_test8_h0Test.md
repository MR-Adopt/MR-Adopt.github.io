## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("103", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional key-value pair ("103", UUID.randomUUID()) in the map. This ensures that the map has a different size than the original input, and also adds a new unique UUID value for the new key.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes a duplicate key-value pair ("101", UUID.randomUUID()). Although this may not be a typical use case for a map, it ensures that the map has the same size as the original input, and also adds a new unique UUID value for the existing key.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes a key with an empty string ("") as the key. This may not be a typical use case for a map, but it ensures that the map has the same size as the original input, and also adds a new unique UUID value for the new key.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put(null, UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes a key with a null value as the key. This may not be a typical use case for a map, but it ensures that the map has the same size as the original input, and also adds a new unique UUID value for the new key.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("101", null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a key-value pair where the value is null. This may not be a typical use case for a map, but it ensures that the map has the same size as the original input, and also adds a new unique UUID value for the existing key.
