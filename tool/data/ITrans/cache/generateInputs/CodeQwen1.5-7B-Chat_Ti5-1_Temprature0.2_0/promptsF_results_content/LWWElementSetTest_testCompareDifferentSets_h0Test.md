# New input pair1:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
## Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is an element that is not present in the set, while the follow-up input is an element that is present in the set. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by being present in the set.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 3, bias);
```
## Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is an element that is not present in the set, while the follow-up input is an element that is present in the set. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by being present in the set.

# New input pair3:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
```
## Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is an element that is not present in the set, while the follow-up input is an element that is present in the set. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by being present in the set.

# New input pair4:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
## Code to generate follow-up input4:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is an element that is not present in the set, while the follow-up input is an element that is present in the set. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by being present in the set.
