## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. Since "1.0-A1" is lexicographically smaller than "1.0-A2", the follow-up input satisfies the relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. Since "1.1.0" is lexicographically smaller than "1.1.1", the follow-up input satisfies the relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. Since "1.1.0-A1" is lexicographically smaller than "1.1.0-A2", the follow-up input satisfies the relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. Since "1.0.0-A1" is lexicographically smaller than "1.0.1", the follow-up input satisfies the relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1+123";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1+456";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. Since "1.0.0-A1+123" is lexicographically smaller than "1.0.0-A1+456", the follow-up input satisfies the relation.
