## New input pair0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 0;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
In the original test case, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 500` and `half = Half.H1`. The result is stored in `test2`.

For the new source input `year = 0`, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 0` and `half = Half.H1`. The result is stored in `test2`.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it calls the method under test with the same arguments as the original test case, and stores the result in the same variable.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
In the original test case, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 500` and `half = Half.H1`. The result is stored in `test2`.

For the new source input `year = 1000`, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 1000` and `half = Half.H2`. The result is stored in `test2`.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it calls the method under test with the same arguments as the original test case, and stores the result in the same variable.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 4000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
In the original test case, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 500` and `half = Half.H1`. The result is stored in `test2`.

For the new source input `year = 4000`, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 4000` and `half = Half.H1`. The result is stored in `test2`.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it calls the method under test with the same arguments as the original test case, and stores the result in the same variable.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 5000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
In the original test case, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 500` and `half = Half.H1`. The result is stored in `test2`.

For the new source input `year = 5000`, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 5000` and `half = Half.H2`. The result is stored in `test2`.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it calls the method under test with the same arguments as the original test case, and stores the result in the same variable.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = -1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
In the original test case, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = 500` and `half = Half.H1`. The result is stored in `test2`.

For the new source input `year = -1`, the method under test `YearHalf.of(int year, int half)` is called with `year = -1` and `half = Half.H1`. The result is stored in `test2`.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it calls the method under test with the same arguments as the original test case, and stores the result in the same variable.
