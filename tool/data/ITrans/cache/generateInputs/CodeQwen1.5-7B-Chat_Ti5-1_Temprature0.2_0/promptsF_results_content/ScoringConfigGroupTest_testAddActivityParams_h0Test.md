## New input pair0:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("");
    String type = "";
```
Follow-up input: `type = ""`
Explanation: Since the source input `ap` is created with an empty string, the `type` should also be an empty string to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams(null);
    String type = null;
```
Follow-up input: `type = null`
Explanation: Since the source input `ap` is created with a `null` value, the `type` should also be `null` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("1234567890");
    String type = "1234567890";
```
Follow-up input: `type = "1234567890"`
Explanation: Since the source input `ap` is created with a string of length 10, the `type` should also be a string of length 10 to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("a".repeat(1000));
    String type = "a".repeat(1000);
```
Follow-up input: `type = "a".repeat(1000)`
Explanation: Since the source input `ap` is created with a string of length 1000, the `type` should also be a string of length 1000 to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type1");
    ap.setMaximumDuration(0);
    String type = "type1";
```
Follow-up input: `type = "type1"`
Explanation: Since the source input `ap` is created with a string "type1" and the maximum duration is set to 0, the `type` should also be "type1" to satisfy the relation.
