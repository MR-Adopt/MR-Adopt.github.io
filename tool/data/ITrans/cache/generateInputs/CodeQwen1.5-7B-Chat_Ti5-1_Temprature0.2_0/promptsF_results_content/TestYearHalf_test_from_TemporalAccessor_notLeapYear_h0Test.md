## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `expected` values are derived from the `date` object. The `year` value is obtained from the `date` object using the `getYear()` method, and the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object. The new input pair satisfies this relation by providing the same `year` and `expected` values as those calculated from the original `date` object.
