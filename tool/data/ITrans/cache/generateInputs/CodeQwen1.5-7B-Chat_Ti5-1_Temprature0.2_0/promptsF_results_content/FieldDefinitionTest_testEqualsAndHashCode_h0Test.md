## New input pair0:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input0 creates a `FieldDefinition` with an empty string as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type. The `deprecate()` method is called on this new `FieldDefinition` to mark it as deprecated. The inferred relation between the `subject` and `other3` is that their hash codes should be different. Since the name and type of both `subject` and `other3` are the same, but one is deprecated and the other is not, their hash codes will be different.

## New input pair1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", null);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", null).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input1 creates a `FieldDefinition` with the name "foo" and `null` as the type. The `deprecate()` method is called on this new `FieldDefinition` to mark it as deprecated. The inferred relation between the `subject` and `other3` is that their hash codes should be different. Since the name and type of both `subject` and `other3` are the same, but one is deprecated and the other is not, their hash codes will be different.

## New input pair2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input2 creates a `FieldDefinition` with the name "foo" and `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and then calls the `deprecate()` method to mark it as deprecated. The inferred relation between the `subject` and `other3` is that their hash codes should be the same. Since the name and type of both `subject` and `other3` are the same, and both are marked as deprecated, their hash codes will be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description").deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input3 creates a `FieldDefinition` with the name "foo", `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and a description. The `deprecate()` method is called on this new `FieldDefinition` to mark it as deprecated. The inferred relation between the `subject` and `other3` is that their hash codes should be different. Since the name, type, and description of both `subject` and `other3` are the same, but one is deprecated and the other is not, their hash codes will be different.

## New input pair4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDefaultValue("default");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDefaultValue("default").deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input4 creates a `FieldDefinition` with the name "foo", `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and a default value. The `deprecate()` method is called on this new `FieldDefinition` to mark it as deprecated. The inferred relation between the `subject` and `other3` is that their hash codes should be different. Since the name, type, and default value of both `subject` and `other3` are the same, but one is deprecated and the other is not, their hash codes will be different.
