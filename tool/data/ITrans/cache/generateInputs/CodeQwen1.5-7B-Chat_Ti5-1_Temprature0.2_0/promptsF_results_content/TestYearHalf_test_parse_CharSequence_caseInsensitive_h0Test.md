## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the text representation of a `YearHalf` object should be the same as the input text. Since the `toString()` method of `YearHalf` returns the text representation of the year and half, the follow-up input is generated by calling `YearHalf.of(year, half).toString()`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h1";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "9999-h1";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 10000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "10000-h2";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 10000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
