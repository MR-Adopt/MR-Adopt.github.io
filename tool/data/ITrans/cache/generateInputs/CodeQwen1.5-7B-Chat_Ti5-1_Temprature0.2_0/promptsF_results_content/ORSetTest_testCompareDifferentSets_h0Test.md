## New input pair0:
```java
    String element2 = "B";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
String element2 = "B";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is a new element to be added to the set, while the follow-up input is an existing element already in the set. Since the `add` method of the `ORSet` class adds a new element to the set, the follow-up input `element2` is an existing element already in the set. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' pass.
