## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 3232235777L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `ipStr1` and the follow-up input `ipLong2` is that the long value obtained from the IP address string is equal to the long value obtained from the IP address string when it is converted to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the source input `ipStr1` to a long value. The long value obtained from the IP address string is `3232235777L`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 167772161L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `ipStr1` and the follow-up input `ipLong2` is that the long value obtained from the IP address string is equal to the long value obtained from the IP address string when it is converted to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the source input `ipStr1` to a long value. The long value obtained from the IP address string is `167772161L`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 2886723584L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `ipStr1` and the follow-up input `ipLong2` is that the long value obtained from the IP address string is equal to the long value obtained from the IP address string when it is converted to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the source input `ipStr1` to a long value. The long value obtained from the IP address string is `2886723584L`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "8.8.8.8";
    long ipLong2 = 134744072L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `ipStr1` and the follow-up input `ipLong2` is that the long value obtained from the IP address string is equal to the long value obtained from the IP address string when it is converted to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the source input `ipStr1` to a long value. The long value obtained from the IP address string is `134744072L`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "255.255.255.255";
    long ipLong2 = 4294967295L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `ipStr1` and the follow-up input `ipLong2` is that the long value obtained from the IP address string is equal to the long value obtained from the IP address string when it is converted to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the source input `ipStr1` to a long value. The long value obtained from the IP address string is `4294967295L`.
