# INFERRED RELATION
The inferred relation between the source input `year` and `half` and the follow-up input `text` is that the `text` can be generated from the `year` and `half` using the `of` method and then parsed using the `parse` method.

# NEW INPUT PAIRS
## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = Year.now().getValue();
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
To generate the `text` for the new source input pair0, we use the `of` method to obtain a `YearHalf` instance from the `year` and `half`, and then call the `toString` method to convert it to a string. This string represents the `year` and `half` in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented by the integer value.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = Year.now().getValue();
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
To generate the `text` for the new source input pair1, we use the `of` method to obtain a `YearHalf` instance from the `year` and `half`, and then call the `toString` method to convert it to a string. This string represents the `year` and `half` in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented by the integer value.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = Year.now().getValue() + 1;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
To generate the `text` for the new source input pair2, we use the `of` method to obtain a `YearHalf` instance from the `year` and `half`, and then call the `toString` method to convert it to a string. This string represents the `year` and `half` in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented by the integer value.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = Year.now().getValue() + 1;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
To generate the `text` for the new source input pair3, we use the `of` method to obtain a `YearHalf` instance from the `year` and `half`, and then call the `toString` method to convert it to a string. This string represents the `year` and `half` in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented by the integer value.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
To generate the `text` for the new source input pair4, we use the `of` method to obtain a `YearHalf` instance from the `year` and `half`, and then call the `toString` method to convert it to a string. This string represents the `year` and `half` in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented by the integer value.
