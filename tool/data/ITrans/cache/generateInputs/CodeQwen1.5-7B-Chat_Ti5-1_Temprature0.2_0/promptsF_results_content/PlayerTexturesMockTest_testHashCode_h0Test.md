## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL should be the same. Since the source input has a different skin URL, the follow-up input has the same skin URL as the source input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL should be the same. Since the source input has a null skin URL, the follow-up input also has a null skin URL.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL and cape URL should be the same. Since the source input has the same skin and cape URLs, the follow-up input also has the same skin and cape URLs.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(null);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL and cape URL should be the same. Since the source input has the same skin and cape URLs, the follow-up input also has the same skin and cape URLs.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(null);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL and cape URL should be the same. Since the source input has the same skin and cape URLs, the follow-up input also has the same skin and cape URLs.
