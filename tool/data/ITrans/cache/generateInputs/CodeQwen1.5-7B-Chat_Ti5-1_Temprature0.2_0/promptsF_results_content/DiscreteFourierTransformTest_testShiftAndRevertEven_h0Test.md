Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it is a square matrix with odd dimensions. The original test case checks the symmetry of the DFT matrix and the reversion of the shift operation. In this case, the original matrix is a 3x3 matrix with odd dimensions, and the shift operation is performed on it. The reversion of the shift operation is then performed on the shifted matrix, and the result should be the original matrix.

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it is a square matrix with odd dimensions. The original test case checks the symmetry of the DFT matrix and the reversion of the shift operation. In this case, the original matrix is a 4x4 matrix with odd dimensions, and the shift operation is performed on it. The reversion of the shift operation is then performed on the shifted matrix, and the result should be the original matrix.

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it is a square matrix with odd dimensions. The original test case checks the symmetry of the DFT matrix and the reversion of the shift operation. In this case, the original matrix is a 5x5 matrix with odd dimensions, and the shift operation is performed on it. The reversion of the shift operation is then performed on the shifted matrix, and the result should be the original matrix.

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it is a square matrix with odd dimensions. The original test case checks the symmetry of the DFT matrix and the reversion of the shift operation. In this case, the original matrix is a 1x1 matrix with odd dimensions, and the shift operation is performed on it. The reversion of the shift operation is then performed on the shifted matrix, and the result should be the original matrix.

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it is a square matrix with odd dimensions. The original test case checks the symmetry of the DFT matrix and the reversion of the shift operation. In this case, the original matrix is a 2x3 matrix with odd dimensions, and the shift operation is performed on it. The reversion of the shift operation is then performed on the shifted matrix, and the result should be the original matrix.
