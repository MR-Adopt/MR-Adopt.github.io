## New input pair0:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";

```
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the job names generated from the task IDs should be different. The source input `taskId1` is the same as the follow-up input `taskId2` except for the last character, which is different. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.
