# INFERRED RELATION
The inferred relation between the pair of test inputs is that the hash codes of the two `AuditInfo` objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and IP address.

# FOLLOW UP INPUTS
## New input pair0:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
The new source input `auditInfo1` has a different IP address than the original `auditInfo1`, but the inferred relation requires that the hash codes of the two `AuditInfo` objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and IP address. Therefore, the new source input `auditInfo1` satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.

## New input pair1:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
```
The new source input `auditInfo1` has a different IP address than the original `auditInfo1`, but the inferred relation requires that the hash codes of the two `AuditInfo` objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and IP address. Therefore, the new source input `auditInfo1` satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.

## New input pair2:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");
```
The new source input `auditInfo1` has a different IP address than the original `auditInfo1`, but the inferred relation requires that the hash codes of the two `AuditInfo` objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and IP address. Therefore, the new source input `auditInfo1` satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.

## New input pair3:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
```
The new source input `auditInfo1` has a different IP address than the original `auditInfo1`, but the inferred relation requires that the hash codes of the two `AuditInfo` objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and IP address. Therefore, the new source input `auditInfo1` satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.

## New input pair4:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
```
The new source input `auditInfo1` has a different IP address than the original `auditInfo1`, but the inferred relation requires that the hash codes of the two `AuditInfo` objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and IP address. Therefore, the new source input `auditInfo1` satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.
