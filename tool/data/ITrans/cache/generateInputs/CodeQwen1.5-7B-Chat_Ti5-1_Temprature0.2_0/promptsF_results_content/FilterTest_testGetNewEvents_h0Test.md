# New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: The new source input0 satisfies the inferred relation by adding the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This ensures that the getNewEvents() method will return the same event object when called on filter2.

# New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "2022-12-31", "Category2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "2022-12-31", "Category2");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: The new source input1 satisfies the inferred relation by adding the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This ensures that the getNewEvents() method will return the same event object when called on filter2.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: The new source input2 satisfies the inferred relation by adding the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This ensures that the getNewEvents() method will return the same event object when called on filter2.

# New input pair3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: The new source input3 satisfies the inferred relation by adding the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This ensures that the getNewEvents() method will return the same event object when called on filter2.

# New input pair4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: The new source input4 satisfies the inferred relation by adding the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This ensures that the getNewEvents() method will return the same event object when called on filter2.
