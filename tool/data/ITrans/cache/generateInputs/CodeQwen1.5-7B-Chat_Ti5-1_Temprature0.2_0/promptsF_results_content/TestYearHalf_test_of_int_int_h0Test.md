## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input0 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the constraints of the method under test. The method `of` takes two parameters, `year` and `half`, and returns an instance of `YearHalf`. The `YearHalf` class has a constructor that takes a year and a half as parameters. The new source input0 satisfies the constraints of the constructor by providing a year of 0 and a half of 1.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input1 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the constraints of the method under test. The method `of` takes two parameters, `year` and `half`, and returns an instance of `YearHalf`. The `YearHalf` class has a constructor that takes a year and a half as parameters. The new source input1 satisfies the constraints of the constructor by providing a year of 9999 and a half of 2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 5000;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input2 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the constraints of the method under test. The method `of` takes two parameters, `year` and `half`, and returns an instance of `YearHalf`. The `YearHalf` class has a constructor that takes a year and a half as parameters. The new source input2 satisfies the constraints of the constructor by providing a year of 5000 and a half of 1.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = -1;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input3 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the constraints of the method under test. The method `of` takes two parameters, `year` and `half`, and returns an instance of `YearHalf`. The `YearHalf` class has a constructor that takes a year and a half as parameters. The new source input3 satisfies the constraints of the constructor by providing a year of -1 and a half of 2.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 10000;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input4 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the constraints of the method under test. The method `of` takes two parameters, `year` and `half`, and returns an instance of `YearHalf`. The `YearHalf` class has a constructor that takes a year and a half as parameters. The new source input4 satisfies the constraints of the constructor by providing a year of 10000 and a half of 1.
