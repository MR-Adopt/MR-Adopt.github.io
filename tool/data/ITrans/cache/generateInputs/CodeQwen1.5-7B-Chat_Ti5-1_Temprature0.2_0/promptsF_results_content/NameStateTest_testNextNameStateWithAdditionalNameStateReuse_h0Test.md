## New input pair0:
```java

    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
    String key2 = "key1";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
    assertEquals(nextNameState, nameState2.getNextNameState(key2));

## New input pair1:
```java

## New input pair2:
```java

## New input pair3:

    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;

    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
    assertEquals(nextNameState, nameState2.getNextNameState(key2));

## New input pair4:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that if `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, then `nameState.getNextNameState(key)` should return the same object as `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)`. This is because the `addNextNameState` method adds a mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` in `nameState`, and the `getNextNameState` method retrieves the mapping from `key` in `nameState`.

For the first new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and a new `NameState` object `nameState2` that is the same object as `nameState`. We then add a mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` in `nameState` and retrieve the mapping from `key2` in `nameState2`. Since `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, the mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` is also present in `nameState2`, and we assert that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` returns the same object as `nextNameState`.

For the second new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and an empty string `key`. We then add a mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` in `nameState` and retrieve the mapping from `key2` in `nameState2`. Since `key` is an empty string, the mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` is not present in `nameState2`, and we assert that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` returns `null`.

For the third new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and a new `NameState` object `nameState2` that is the same object as `nameState`. We then add a mapping from `key` to `null` in `nameState` and retrieve the mapping from `key2` in `nameState2`. Since `key` is not present in `nameState`, the mapping from `key` to `null` is not present in `nameState2`, and we assert that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` returns `null`.

For the fourth new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and a new `NameState` object `nameState2` that is the same object as `nameState`. We then add a mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` in `nextNameState` and add a mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` in `nameState`. We then retrieve the mapping from `key2` in `nameState2`. Since `nextNameState` and `nameState` are the same object, the mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` is also present in `nameState2`, and we assert that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` returns the same object as `nextNameState`.

For the fifth new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and a new `NameState` object `nameState2` that is the same object as `nameState`. We then add a mapping from `key` to `null` in `nextNameState` and add a mapping from `key` to `nextNameState` in `nameState`. We then retrieve the mapping from `key2` in `nameState2`. Since `nextNameState` and `nameState` are the same object, the mapping from `key` to `null` is also present in `nameState2`, and we assert that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` returns `null`.
