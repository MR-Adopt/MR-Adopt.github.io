## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `l2` is that `l2` should be equal to `l`. The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `b` is that `b` should be equal to `false`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `l2` is that `l2` should be equal to `l`. The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `b` is that `b` should be equal to `false`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `l2` is that `l2` should be equal to `l`. The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `b` is that `b` should be equal to `false`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = 1;
    long l2 = 1;
    boolean b = true;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `l2` is that `l2` should be equal to `l`. The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `b` is that `b` should be equal to `true`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
    long l2 = 500000000;
    boolean b = true;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `l2` is that `l2` should be equal to `l`. The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up input `b` is that `b` should be equal to `true`.
