## New input pair0:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[0];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    Class<ZonedDateTime[]> manifest = ZonedDateTime[].class;
    byte[] body = { 91, 93, 0, 0 };
    int size = 5;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the source input and follow-up input should have the same length and content. In this case, the source input has a length of 0, and the follow-up input has a length of 5. The content of both inputs is also the same, which is an empty array of ZonedDateTime objects.

## New input pair1:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[1];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    Class<ZonedDateTime[]> manifest = ZonedDateTime[].class;
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0 };
    int size = 23;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the source input and follow-up input should have the same length and content. In this case, the source input has a length of 1, and the follow-up input has a length of 23. The content of both inputs is also the same, which is an array of one ZonedDateTime object.

## New input pair2:

    Class<ZonedDateTime[]> manifest = ZonedDateTime[].class;
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 44, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 44, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0 };
    int size = 115;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the source input and follow-up input should have the same length and content. In this case, the source input has a length of 100, and the follow-up input has a length of 115. The content of both inputs is also the same, which is an array of 100 ZonedDateTime objects.
