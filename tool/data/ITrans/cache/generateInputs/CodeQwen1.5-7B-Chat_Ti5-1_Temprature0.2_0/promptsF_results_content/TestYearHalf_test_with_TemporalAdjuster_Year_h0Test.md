## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since the source input `year1` and `half1` are the same as the follow-up input `year3` and `half3`, the result of the method under test should also be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since the source input `year1` and `half1` are the same as the follow-up input `year3` and `half3`, the result of the method under test should also be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since the source input `year1` and `half1` are the same as the follow-up input `year3` and `half3`, the result of the method under test should also be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1800;
    int year3 = 1800;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1800;
    int year3 = 1800;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since the source input `year1` and `half1` are the same as the follow-up input `year3` and `half3`, the result of the method under test should also be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
