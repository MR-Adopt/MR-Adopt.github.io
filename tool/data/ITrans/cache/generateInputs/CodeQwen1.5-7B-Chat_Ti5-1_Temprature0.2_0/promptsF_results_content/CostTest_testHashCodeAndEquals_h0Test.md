# New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since subject and other have the same value, their hashCodes should also be the same.

# New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since subject and other have the same value, their hashCodes should also be the same.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since subject and other have the same value, their hashCodes should also be the same.

# New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since subject and other have the same value, their hashCodes should also be the same.

# New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(5);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(5);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since subject and other have the same value, their hashCodes should also be the same.
