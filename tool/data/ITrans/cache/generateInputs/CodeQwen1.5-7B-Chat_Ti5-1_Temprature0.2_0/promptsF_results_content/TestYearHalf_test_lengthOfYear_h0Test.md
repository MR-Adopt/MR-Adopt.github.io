# New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 2);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half-of-year are related to the length of the year. In this case, the year 2020 is a leap year, so the length of the year is 366. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is created by passing the year 2020 and half-of-year 2 to the `YearHalf.of` method, which returns an instance of `YearHalf` with the specified year and half-of-year. This input satisfies the inferred relation because it results in a length of 366, which matches the expected length of a leap year.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 1);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half-of-year are related to the length of the year. In this case, the year 1900 is not a leap year, so the length of the year is 365. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is created by passing the year 1900 and half-of-year 1 to the `YearHalf.of` method, which returns an instance of `YearHalf` with the specified year and half-of-year. This input satisfies the inferred relation because it results in a length of 365, which matches the expected length of a non-leap year.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 2);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half-of-year are related to the length of the year. In this case, the year 2000 is a leap year, so the length of the year is 366. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is created by passing the year 2000 and half-of-year 2 to the `YearHalf.of` method, which returns an instance of `YearHalf` with the specified year and half-of-year. This input satisfies the inferred relation because it results in a length of 366, which matches the expected length of a leap year.

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1600;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1600, 1);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half-of-year are related to the length of the year. In this case, the year 1600 is a leap year, so the length of the year is 366. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is created by passing the year 1600 and half-of-year 1 to the `YearHalf.of` method, which returns an instance of `YearHalf` with the specified year and half-of-year. This input satisfies the inferred relation because it results in a length of 366, which matches the expected length of a leap year.

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1800, 2);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half-of-year are related to the length of the year. In this case, the year 1800 is not a leap year, so the length of the year is 365. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is created by passing the year 1800 and half-of-year 2 to the `YearHalf.of` method, which returns an instance of `YearHalf` with the specified year and half-of-year. This input satisfies the inferred relation because it results in a length of 365, which matches the expected length of a non-leap year.
