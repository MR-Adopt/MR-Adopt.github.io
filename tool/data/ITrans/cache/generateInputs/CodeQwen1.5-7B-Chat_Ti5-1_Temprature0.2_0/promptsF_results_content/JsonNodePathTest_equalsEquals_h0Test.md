## New input pair0:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
    String token2 = "b";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "b" and `token2` is "b", `a1` and `a2` are equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String token1 = "123";
    String token2 = "123";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "123" and `token2` is "123", `a1` and `a2` are equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String token1 = "a/b";
    String token2 = "a/b";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "a/b" and `token2` is "a/b", `a1` and `a2` are equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String token1 = "";
    String token2 = "";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "" and `token2` is "", `a1` and `a2` are equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String token1 = "a#b";
    String token2 = "a#b";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "a#b" and `token2` is "a#b", `a1` and `a2` are equal.
