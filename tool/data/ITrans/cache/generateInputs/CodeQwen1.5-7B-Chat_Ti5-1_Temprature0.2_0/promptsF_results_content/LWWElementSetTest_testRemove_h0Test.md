## New input pair0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that when an element is added to the set, it should be removed when the same element is removed. Since the source input is `element` with `key1` and `0` value, and the follow-up input is `element2` with the same `key1` and `0` value, they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that when an element is added to the set, it should be removed when the same element is removed. Since the source input is `element` with `key1` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` value, and the follow-up input is `element2` with the same `key1` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` value, they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that when an element is added to the set, it should be removed when the same element is removed. Since the source input is `element` with `key1` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` value, and the follow-up input is `element2` with the same `key1` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` value, they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", -1, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", -1, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that when an element is added to the set, it should be removed when the same element is removed. Since the source input is `element` with `key1` and `-1` value, and the follow-up input is `element2` with the same `key1` and `-1` value, they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that when an element is added to the set, it should be removed when the same element is removed. Since the source input is `element` with `key1` and `1` value and `null` bias, and the follow-up input is `element2` with the same `key1` and `1` value and `null` bias, they satisfy the inferred relation.
