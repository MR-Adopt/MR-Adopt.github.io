# New input pair0:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input `value = 0L` satisfies the inferred relation because it is a valid input for the `encrypt` method. The `encrypt` method takes a `Long` value as input and returns an encrypted string. Therefore, the `message` variable is assigned the result of calling the `encrypt` method with the `value` variable as the argument.

# New input pair1:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input `value = Long.MAX_VALUE` satisfies the inferred relation because it is a valid input for the `encrypt` method. The `encrypt` method takes a `Long` value as input and returns an encrypted string. Therefore, the `message` variable is assigned the result of calling the `encrypt` method with the `value` variable as the argument.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input `value = -1L` satisfies the inferred relation because it is a valid input for the `encrypt` method. The `encrypt` method takes a `Long` value as input and returns an encrypted string. Therefore, the `message` variable is assigned the result of calling the `encrypt` method with the `value` variable as the argument.

# New input pair3:
```java
    Long value = 100_000L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input `value = 100_000L` satisfies the inferred relation because it is a valid input for the `encrypt` method. The `encrypt` method takes a `Long` value as input and returns an encrypted string. Therefore, the `message` variable is assigned the result of calling the `encrypt` method with the `value` variable as the argument.

# New input pair4:
```java
    Long value = null;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input `value = null` satisfies the inferred relation because it is a valid input for the `encrypt` method. The `encrypt` method takes a `Long` value as input and returns an encrypted string. Therefore, the `message` variable is assigned the result of calling the `encrypt` method with the `value` variable as the argument.
