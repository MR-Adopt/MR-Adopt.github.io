## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal when the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to 0 and the `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are the same. This is because the `getBlobServiceClient` method uses a `Map` to cache clients based on the `storageAccount` and `retryCount`. When the `retryCount` is 0, the method will always use the same `retryCount` for the same `storageAccount`, so the clients will be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal when the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to 5 and the `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are the same. This is because the `getBlobServiceClient` method uses a `Map` to cache clients based on the `storageAccount` and `retryCount`. When the `retryCount` is 5, the method will always use the same `retryCount` for the same `storageAccount`, so the clients will be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "another_account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "another_account";
```

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "another_account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "another_account";
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal when the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to `null` and the `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are the same. This is because the `getBlobServiceClient` method uses a `Map` to cache clients based on the `storageAccount` and `retryCount`. When the `retryCount` is `null`, the method will always use the same `retryCount` for the same `storageAccount`, so the clients will be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal when the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to 10 and the `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are the same. This is because the `getBlobServiceClient` method uses a `Map` to cache clients based on the `storageAccount` and `retryCount`. When the `retryCount` is 10, the method will always use the same `retryCount` for the same `storageAccount`, so the clients will be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal when the `retryCount1` is `null` and `retryCount2` is set to 5 and the `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are the same.
