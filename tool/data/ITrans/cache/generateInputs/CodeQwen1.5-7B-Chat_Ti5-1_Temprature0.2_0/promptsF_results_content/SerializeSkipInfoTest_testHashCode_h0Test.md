## New input pair0:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. In this case, the new source input0 has an empty fieldName, which is equal to the fieldName in the original test case. Similarly, the new source input0 has the same fullClassName as the original test case, which also satisfies the relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. In this case, the new source input1 has an empty fullClassName, which is equal to the fullClassName in the original test case. Similarly, the new source input1 has the same fieldName as the original test case, which also satisfies the relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. In this case, the new source input2 has the same fieldName and fullClassName as the original test case, which satisfies the relation.
