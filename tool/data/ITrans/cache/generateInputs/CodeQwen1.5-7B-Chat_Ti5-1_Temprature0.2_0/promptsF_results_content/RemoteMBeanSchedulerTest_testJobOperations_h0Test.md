## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("A durable job").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
In the original test case, `job2Detail` is created with a description "A durable job". When adding this job to the scheduler using `remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false)`, it should be retrieved using `remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22)` and the returned job detail should have the same description.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withPriority(10).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
In the original test case, `job2Detail` is created with a priority of 10. When adding this job to the scheduler using `remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false)`, it should be retrieved using `remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22)` and the returned job detail should have the same priority.

## New input pair2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withJobData(new JobDataMap()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
In the original test case, `job2Detail` is created with an empty JobDataMap. When adding this job to the scheduler using `remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false)`, it should be retrieved using `remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22)` and the returned job detail should have the same JobDataMap.

## New input pair3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTrigger(new SimpleTrigger("trigger1", "group1", new Date())).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
In the original test case, `job2Detail` is created with a trigger. When adding this job to the scheduler using `remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false)`, it should be retrieved using `remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22)` and the returned job detail should have the same trigger.

## New input pair4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withSchedule(CronScheduleBuilder.cronSchedule("0 0 12 * *?")).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
In the original test case, `job2Detail` is created with a cron schedule. When adding this job to the scheduler using `remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false)`, it should be retrieved using `remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22)` and the returned job detail should have the same cron schedule.
