## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input0:
```java
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half2;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half2;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half2;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half2;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input4:
```java
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half2;
```

The inferred relation is that the `withHalf` method of the `YearHalf` class returns a new `YearHalf` object with the specified half-of-year. Therefore, for each new source input, the corresponding follow-up input is obtained by simply setting `year3` and `half3` to the same values as `year1` and `half2`, respectively. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the original test case pass.
