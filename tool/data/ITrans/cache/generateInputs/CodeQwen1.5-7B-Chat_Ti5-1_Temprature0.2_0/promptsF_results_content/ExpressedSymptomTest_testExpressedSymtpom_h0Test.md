## New input pair0:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "testModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "testModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation: The new source input0 is a different symptom (fever) with the same module ("testModule"). The inferred relation is that the symptom object and its copy (symptom2) should have the same last updated time for the given module. Since the symptom object is updated with the same module and cause, the last updated time should remain the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String name = "pain";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation: The new source input1 is a different symptom (pain) with an empty module (""). The inferred relation is that the symptom object and its copy (symptom2) should have the same last updated time for the given module. Since the symptom object is updated with an empty module and cause, the last updated time should remain the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String name = "pain";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = null;
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = null;
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation: The new source input2 is a different symptom (pain) with a null module (null). The inferred relation is that the symptom object and its copy (symptom2) should have the same last updated time for the given module. Since the symptom object is updated with a null module and cause, the last updated time should remain the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String name = "pain";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "testModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "testModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation: The new source input3 is the same as the original source input. The inferred relation is that the symptom object and its copy (symptom2) should have the same last updated time for the given module. Since the symptom object is updated with the same module and cause, the last updated time should remain the same.
