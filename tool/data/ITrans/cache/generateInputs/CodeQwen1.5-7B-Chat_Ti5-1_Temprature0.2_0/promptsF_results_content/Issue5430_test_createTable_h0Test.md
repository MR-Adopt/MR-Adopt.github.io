## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation is that the original SQL and the new SQL are equivalent after normalization. The normalization process involves removing unnecessary whitespace, tabs, and single quotes, and replacing double quotes with single quotes. The new SQL is obtained by replacing the single quotes with double quotes in the original SQL.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation is that the original SQL and the new SQL are equivalent after normalization. The normalization process involves removing unnecessary whitespace, tabs, and single quotes, and replacing double quotes with single quotes. The new SQL is obtained by replacing the single quotes with double quotes in the original SQL.

## New input pair2:

    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

The normalization process involves removing unnecessary whitespace, tabs, and single quotes, and replacing double quotes with single quotes. The new SQL is obtained by replacing the single quotes with double quotes in the original SQL.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation is that the original SQL and the new SQL are equivalent after normalization. The normalization process involves removing unnecessary whitespace, tabs, and single quotes, and replacing double quotes with single quotes. The new SQL is obtained by replacing the single quotes with double quotes in the original SQL.

## New input pair4:
```java
