# New input pair0:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group fields are equal. Since the group field is the only field in the InFlightRequestKey class, the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if they are the same object. Therefore, the follow-up input `requestKey2` is the same as `requestKey1`.

# New input pair1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group fields are equal. Since the group field is the only field in the InFlightRequestKey class, the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if they are the same object. Therefore, the follow-up input `requestKey2` is the same as `requestKey1`.

# New input pair2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group fields are equal. Since the group field is the only field in the InFlightRequestKey class, the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if they are the same object. Therefore, the follow-up input `requestKey2` is the same as `requestKey1`.

# New input pair3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group fields are equal. Since the group field is the only field in the InFlightRequestKey class, the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if they are the same object. Therefore, the follow-up input `requestKey2` is the same as `requestKey1`.

# New input pair4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0);
```
