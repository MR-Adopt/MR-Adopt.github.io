## New input pair0:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(0, 0);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":0,\"value\":0}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the JSON string representation of a Pair object should match the key-value pairs in the JSON object. Since the source input pair has both key and value as 0, the corresponding JSON string should also have both key and value as 0.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":2147483647,\"value\":2147483647}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the JSON string representation of a Pair object should match the key-value pairs in the JSON object. Since the source input pair has both key and value as the maximum integer value, the corresponding JSON string should also have both key and value as the maximum integer value.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":-2147483648,\"value\":-2147483648}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the JSON string representation of a Pair object should match the key-value pairs in the JSON object. Since the source input pair has both key and value as the minimum integer value, the corresponding JSON string should also have both key and value as the minimum integer value.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(null, null);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":null,\"value\":null}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the JSON string representation of a Pair object should match the key-value pairs in the JSON object. Since the source input pair has both key and value as null, the corresponding JSON string should also have both key and value as null.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(1, null);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":1,\"value\":null}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the JSON string representation of a Pair object should match the key-value pairs in the JSON object. Since the source input pair has a key as 1 and a value as null, the corresponding JSON string should also have both key and value as null.
