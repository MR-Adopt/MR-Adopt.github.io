## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
The inferred relation between the original test case and the method under test is that the `normalizeSql` method is used to normalize the SQL input. The new source input `sql` is normalized using the `normalizeSql` method, and the resulting `newSql` is compared to the expected output using the `assertEquals` method.

The code used to generate the follow-up input is as follows:
```java
    String newSql = normalizeSql(sql);
```
This code simply calls the `normalizeSql` method with the original `sql` input and assigns the result to the `newSql` variable. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `normalizeSql` method is used to transform the original input into a normalized form that is then compared to the expected output.
