## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the expected value is calculated based on the month value of the date. If the month value is 1, 2, or 3, the expected value is 1. If the month value is 4, 5, or 6, the expected value is 2. If the month value is 7, 8, or 9, the expected value is 3. If the month value is 10, 11, or 12, the expected value is 4. Therefore, if the year is 2009, the expected value is calculated as ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2010;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2010;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the expected value is calculated based on the month value of the date. If the month value is 1, 2, or 3, the expected value is 1. If the month value is 4, 5, or 6, the expected value is 2. If the month value is 7, 8, or 9, the expected value is 3. If the month value is 10, 11, or 12, the expected value is 4. Therefore, if the year is 2010, the expected value is calculated as ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2011;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2011;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the expected value is calculated based on the month value of the date. If the month value is 1, 2, or 3, the expected value is 1. If the month value is 4, 5, or 6, the expected value is 2. If the month value is 7, 8, or 9, the expected value is 3. If the month value is 10, 11, or 12, the expected value is 4. Therefore, if the year is 2011, the expected value is calculated as ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1.
