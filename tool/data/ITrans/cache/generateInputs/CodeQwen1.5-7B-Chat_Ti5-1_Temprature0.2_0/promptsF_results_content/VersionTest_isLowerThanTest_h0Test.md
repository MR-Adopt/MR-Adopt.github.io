## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "0.9";
    String v2 = "0.9";
```

### Construction code:
```java
@Test
public void isLowerThanTest() {
    String v1 = "0.9";
    String v2 = "0.9";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertTrue(a.isLowerThan(b));
}
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the pair of test inputs is that the version `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "0.9" is lexicographically smaller than "0.9", the new source input `v1 = "0.9"` satisfies the inferred relation with `v2 = "0.9"`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.0";
```

### Construction code:
```java
@Test
public void isLowerThanTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.0";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertTrue(a.isLowerThan(b));
}
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the pair of test inputs is that the version `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "1.0.0" is lexicographically equal to "1.0.0", the new source input `v1 = "1.0.0"` satisfies the inferred relation with `v2 = "1.0.0"`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.9";
    String v2 = "1.9";
```

### Construction code:
```java
@Test
public void isLowerThanTest() {
    String v1 = "1.9";
    String v2 = "1.9";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertTrue(a.isLowerThan(b));
}
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the pair of test inputs is that the version `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "1.9" is lexicographically equal to "1.9", the new source input `v1 = "1.9"` satisfies the inferred relation with `v2 = "1.9"`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```

### Construction code:
```java
@Test
public void isLowerThanTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertTrue(a.isLowerThan(b));
}
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the pair of test inputs is that the version `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "1.0-A1" is lexicographically equal to "1.0-A1", the new source input `v1 = "1.0-A1"` satisfies the inferred relation with `v2 = "1.0-A1"`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```

### Construction code:
```java
@Test
public void isLowerThanTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertTrue(a.isLowerThan(b));
}
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the pair of test inputs is that the version `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "1.0.0-A1" is lexicographically equal to "1.0.0-A1", the new source input `v1 = "1.0.0-A1"` satisfies the inferred relation with `v2 = "1.0.0-A1"`.
