## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7F";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device address of `i2cMux` should update the device address of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, we create a new `i2cMux2` instance and set its device address to the same value as `deviceAddress`. Then, we assert that the device addresses of `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2` are equal.

    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
