## New input pair0:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000001");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 46, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 34, 44, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 46, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by changing the time values in the `LocalTime` array to "00:00:00.000000000". The `JsonWriter` is initialized with a buffer size of 20, and the `LocalTime` array is filled with the new time value. The `byte[]` body is constructed based on the serialized JSON representation of the `LocalTime` array, and the `int` size is set to the length of the body.

## New input pair1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 51, 58, 53, 57, 58, 57, 57, 46, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 34, 44, 34, 50, 51, 58, 53, 57, 58, 57, 57, 46, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };

## New input pair2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[0];

    byte[] body = { 91, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 10;
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by changing the size of the `LocalTime` array to 0. The `JsonWriter` is initialized with a buffer size of 20, and the `LocalTime` array is filled with the new size. The `byte[]` body is constructed based on the serialized JSON representation of the `LocalTime` array, and the `int` size is set to the length of the body.

## New input pair3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[100];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 43;
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by changing the size of the `LocalTime` array to 100. The `JsonWriter` is initialized with a buffer size of 20, and the `LocalTime` array is filled with the new size. The `byte[]` body is constructed based on the serialized JSON representation of the `LocalTime` array, and the `int` size is set to the length of the body.

## New input pair4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[1];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 43;
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by changing the size of the `LocalTime` array to 1. The `JsonWriter` is initialized with a buffer size of 20, and the `LocalTime` array is filled with the new size. The `byte[]` body is constructed based on the serialized JSON representation of the `LocalTime` array, and the `int` size is set to the length of the body.
