## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 1;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 3;
int amount = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the difference between two quarters is equal to the number of quarters between them. Since the difference between quarters 1 and 3 is 2, the amount should be 2.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 2;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 4;
int amount = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the difference between two quarters is equal to the number of quarters between them. Since the difference between quarters 2 and 4 is 2, the amount should be 2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 3;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 1;
int amount = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the difference between two quarters is equal to the number of quarters between them. Since the difference between quarters 3 and 1 is 2, the amount should be 2.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 4;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 2;
int amount = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the difference between two quarters is equal to the number of quarters between them. Since the difference between quarters 4 and 2 is 2, the amount should be 2.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 5;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 5;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 3;
int amount = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the difference between two quarters is equal to the number of quarters between them. Since the difference between quarters 5 and 3 is 2, the amount should be 2.
