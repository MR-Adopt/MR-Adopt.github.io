## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is not equal to `v2`, then `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `false`. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same version with different pre-release identifiers, they are not equal, so `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `false`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `true`. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same version, they are equal, so `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `true`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `true`. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same version with different pre-release identifiers, they are equal, so `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `true`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `true`. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same version with different pre-release identifiers, they are equal, so `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `true`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.0";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `true`. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same version, they are equal, so `v1.isEqual(v2)` should return `true`.
