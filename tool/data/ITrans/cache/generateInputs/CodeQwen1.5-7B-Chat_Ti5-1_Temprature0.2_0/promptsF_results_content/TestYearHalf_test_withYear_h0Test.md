# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1`, `half1`, and `year2` are the same, the follow-up input `year3` and `half3` should also be the same as `year1` and `half1`.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1`, `half1`, and `year2` are the same, the follow-up input `year3` and `half3` should also be the same as `year1` and `half1`.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1`, `half1`, and `year2` are the same, the follow-up input `year3` and `half3` should also be the same as `year1` and `half1`.

    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 2;

```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1`, `half1`, and `year2` are the same, the follow-up input `year3` and `half3` should also be the same as `year1` and `half1`.

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 1700;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1700;
    int year3 = 1700;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 1700;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1700;
    int year3 = 1700;
