## New input pair0:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `getCacheKey()` method of `IsFalseDimFilter` should return the same value for two `EqualityFilter` objects with the same field name, value, and type. Since the field name of `f3` is different from the field name of `f4`, they should not have the same cache key.

## New input pair1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `getCacheKey()` method of `IsFalseDimFilter` should return the same value for two `EqualityFilter` objects with the same field name, value, and type. Since the type of `f3` is different from the type of `f4`, they should not have the same cache key.

## New input pair2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `getCacheKey()` method of `IsFalseDimFilter` should return the same value for two `EqualityFilter` objects with the same field name, value, and type. Since the value of `f3` is different from the value of `f4`, they should not have the same cache key.

## New input pair3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `getCacheKey()` method of `IsFalseDimFilter` should return the same value for two `EqualityFilter` objects with the same field name, value, and type. Since the filter expression of `f3` is different from the filter expression of `f4`, they should not have the same cache key.

## New input pair4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter(null, ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter(null, ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
