## New input pair0:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: Since the number of threads is set to 0, the pool will always return a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance for each acquire operation, regardless of the number of times the pool is acquired. Therefore, the follow-up input `virtualPool2` is the same as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: Since the number of threads is set to 1, the pool will always return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance for each acquire operation, regardless of the number of times the pool is acquired. Therefore, the follow-up input `virtualPool2` is the same as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: Since the number of threads is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the pool will always return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance for each acquire operation, regardless of the number of times the pool is acquired. Therefore, the follow-up input `virtualPool2` is the same as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: Since the number of threads is set to `-1`, the pool will always return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance for each acquire operation, regardless of the number of times the pool is acquired. Therefore, the follow-up input `virtualPool2` is the same as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(2);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(2);
```
Explanation: Since the number of threads is set to 2, the pool will always return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance for each acquire operation, regardless of the number of times the pool is acquired. Therefore, the follow-up input `virtualPool2` is the same as the source input `virtualPool`.
