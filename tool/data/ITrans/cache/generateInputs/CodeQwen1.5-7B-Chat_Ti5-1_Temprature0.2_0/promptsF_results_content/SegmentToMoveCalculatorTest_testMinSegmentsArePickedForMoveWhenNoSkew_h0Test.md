## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 50_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 50_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the computed minimum segments to move in the tier, which is calculated based on the total number of segments in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 50,000, the minimum number of segments to move in the tier is also 50,000. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the computed minimum segments to move in the tier, which is calculated based on the total number of segments in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 100,000, the minimum number of segments to move in the tier is also 100,000. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 200_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 200_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the computed minimum segments to move in the tier, which is calculated based on the total number of segments in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 200,000, the minimum number of segments to move in the tier is also 200,000. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 500_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 500_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the computed minimum segments to move in the tier, which is calculated based on the total number of segments in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 500,000, the minimum number of segments to move in the tier is also 500,000. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1_000_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1_000_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));

```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the computed minimum segments to move in the tier, which is calculated based on the total number of segments in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 1,000,000, the minimum number of segments to move in the tier is also 1,000,000. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.
