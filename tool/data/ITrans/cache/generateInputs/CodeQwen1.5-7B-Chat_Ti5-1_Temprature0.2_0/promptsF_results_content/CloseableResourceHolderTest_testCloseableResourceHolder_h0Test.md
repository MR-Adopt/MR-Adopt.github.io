## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and should contain the same `closeable` object as the original `holder`. The new source input `closeable` is a lambda expression that does not throw any exceptions. When we call `ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable)`, it creates a new instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` with the provided `closeable` object. Therefore, `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and contain the same `closeable` object as the original `holder`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and should contain the same `closeable` object as the original `holder`. The new source input `closeable` is an anonymous inner class that throws an `IOException` when the `close` method is called. When we call `ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable)`, it creates a new instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` with the provided `closeable` object. Therefore, `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and contain the same `closeable` object as the original `holder`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and should contain the same `closeable` object as the original `holder`. The new source input `closeable` is an anonymous inner class that does nothing when the `close` method is called. When we call `ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable)`, it creates a new instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` with the provided `closeable` object. Therefore, `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and contain the same `closeable` object as the original `holder`.
