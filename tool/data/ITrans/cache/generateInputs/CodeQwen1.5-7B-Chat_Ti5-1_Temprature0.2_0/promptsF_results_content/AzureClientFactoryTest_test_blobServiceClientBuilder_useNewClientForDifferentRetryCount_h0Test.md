## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` should be equal since we are testing the behavior of the `getBlobServiceClient` method when the retry count is set to 0.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` should be equal since we are testing the behavior of the `getBlobServiceClient` method when the retry count is set to 3.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` should be equal since we are testing the behavior of the `getBlobServiceClient` method when the retry count is set to 5.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` should be equal since we are testing the behavior of the `getBlobServiceClient` method when the retry count is set to 10.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 100;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 100;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` should be equal since we are testing the behavior of the `getBlobServiceClient` method when the retry count is set to 100.
