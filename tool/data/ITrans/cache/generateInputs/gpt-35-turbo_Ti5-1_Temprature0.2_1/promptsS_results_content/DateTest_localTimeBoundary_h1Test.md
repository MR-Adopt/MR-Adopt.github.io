## New input1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` variable to the LocalTime value of "00:00:00", which represents midnight. It creates a new JsonWriter with a capacity of 20 and initializes an array `lts` with two elements, both set to the `now` value. This input is valid as it tests the boundary case of the LocalTime value being the start of the day.

## New input2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` variable to the LocalTime value of "23:59:59.999999999", which represents the end of the day. It creates a new JsonWriter with a capacity of 20 and initializes an array `lts` with two elements, both set to the `now` value. This input is valid as it tests the boundary case of the LocalTime value being the end of the day.

## New input3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("06:30:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` variable to the LocalTime value of "06:30:00", which represents a specific time during the day. It creates a new JsonWriter with a capacity of 20 and initializes an array `lts` with two elements, both set to the `now` value. This input is valid as it tests a specific time during the day.

## New input4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("15:45:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` variable to the LocalTime value of "15:45:30", which represents a specific time during the day. It creates a new JsonWriter with a capacity of 20 and initializes an array `lts` with two elements, both set to the `now` value. This input is valid as it tests a specific time during the day.

## New input5:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("09:00:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` variable to the LocalTime value of "09:00:00", which represents a specific time during the day. It creates a new JsonWriter with a capacity of 20 and initializes an array `lts` with two elements, both set to the `now` value. This input is valid as it tests a specific time during the day.
