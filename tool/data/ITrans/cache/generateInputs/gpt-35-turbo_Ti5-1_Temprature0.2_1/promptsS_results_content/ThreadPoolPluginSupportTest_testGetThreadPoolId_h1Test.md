## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 1, 1, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 1, and a queue size of 1. This tests the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when the thread pool is configured with minimal resources.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 10, 20, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size of 10, maximum pool size of 20, and a queue size of 10. This tests the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when the thread pool is configured with larger resources.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 5, and an unbounded queue. This tests the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when the thread pool is configured with an unbounded queue.

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 0, 10, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size of 0 and maximum pool size of 10. This tests the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when the thread pool is configured with a core pool size of 0.

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 5, and a queue size of 1. This tests the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when the thread pool is configured with a different rejection policy (`CallerRunsPolicy`).
