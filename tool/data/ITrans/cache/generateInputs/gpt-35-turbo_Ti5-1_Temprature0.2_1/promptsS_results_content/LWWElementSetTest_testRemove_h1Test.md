## New input1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with a different key and value compared to the original test case. This helps to test the `remove` method with a different element.

## New input2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with the same key but a different value compared to the original test case. This helps to test the `remove` method with an element having the same key but different value.

## New input3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with a different key but the same value compared to the original test case. This helps to test the `remove` method with an element having a different key but the same value.

## New input4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with the same key, value, but a different bias compared to the original test case. This helps to test the `remove` method with an element having the same key and value but a different bias.

## New input5:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with a different key, value, and bias compared to the original test case. This helps to test the `remove` method with a completely different element.
