## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("abc", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new HashMap `v01` with a single entry where the key is "abc" and the value is 456.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("xyz", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new HashMap `v01` with a single entry where the key is "xyz" and the value is 789.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456);
    v01.put("789", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new HashMap `v01` with two entries. The first entry has the key "456" and the value 456, and the second entry has the key "789" and the value 789.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("abc", 123);
    v01.put("xyz", 456);
    v01.put("123", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new HashMap `v01` with three entries. The first entry has the key "abc" and the value 123, the second entry has the key "xyz" and the value 456, and the third entry has the key "123" and the value 789.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new empty HashMap `v01`.
