## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are setting `mockEvent` to `null` to test the behavior of the program when a `null` event is added to the filter.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are setting `filter` to `null` to test the behavior of the program when a `null` filter is used to add an event.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This test input is similar to the original test case, where we add a single event to the filter. This input is valid as it tests the behavior of the program when a single event is added.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: In this test input, we add the same event twice to the filter. This input is valid as it tests the behavior of the program when duplicate events are added.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(null);
```
Explanation: In this test input, we add a `null` event to the filter after adding a valid event. This input is valid as it tests the behavior of the program when a `null` event is added after a valid event.
