## New input1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
This is the original test input and it is valid because it creates a new job detail with the job key "job2" and the group key specified in the `GROUP_KEY` variable. The job detail is stored durably, meaning it will persist even if there are no triggers associated with it.

## New input2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
This input is valid because it creates a new job detail with the job key "job3" and the same group key as the original test input. The job detail is stored durably.

## New input3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", "group2")).storeDurably().build();
```
This input is valid because it creates a new job detail with the same job key as the original test input, but a different group key. The job detail is stored durably.

## New input4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job4", "group3")).storeDurably().build();
```
This input is valid because it creates a new job detail with a different job key and group key compared to the original test input. The job detail is stored durably.

## New input5:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job5", "group4")).storeDurably().build();
```
This input is valid because it creates a new job detail with a different job key and group key compared to the original test input. The job detail is stored durably.
