## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to 0, indicating that no retries should be performed.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to a positive value, indicating the number of retries to be performed.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to a negative value, indicating that the default `maxTries` value from `AzureAccountConfig` should be used.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account2";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `ACCOUNT1` value is different from the original test case, ensuring that a new client is created for a different storage account.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `ACCOUNT1` value is an empty string, ensuring that a new client is created even if the storage account name is empty.
