## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `IsFalseDimFilter` when the value of the `EqualityFilter` is an empty string.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `IsFalseDimFilter` when the value of the `EqualityFilter` is a different string.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `IsFalseDimFilter` when the column name of the `EqualityFilter` is different.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.LONG, 123, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `IsFalseDimFilter` when the column type of the `EqualityFilter` is different.

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `IsFalseDimFilter` when the dimension value of the `EqualityFilter` is different.
