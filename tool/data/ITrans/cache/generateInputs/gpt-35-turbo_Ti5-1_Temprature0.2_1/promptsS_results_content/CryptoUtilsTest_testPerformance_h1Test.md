## New input3:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the value to be encrypted is a negative value.

## New input4:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the value to be encrypted is the maximum possible value for a Long.

## New input5:
```java
    Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the value to be encrypted is the minimum possible value for a Long.
