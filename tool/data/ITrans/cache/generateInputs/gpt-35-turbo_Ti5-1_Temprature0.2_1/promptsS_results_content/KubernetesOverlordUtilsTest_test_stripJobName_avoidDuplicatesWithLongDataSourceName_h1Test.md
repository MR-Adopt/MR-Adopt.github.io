```
This input is valid because it is the same as the original test case `taskId1`. It is important to include the original input as a test case to ensure that the method handles the input correctly.

## New input5:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z_123";
