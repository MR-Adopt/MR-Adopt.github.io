## New input1:
```java
    Integer v01 = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the program's ability to handle a minimum value for `v01`.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer v01 = -1001;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the program's ability to handle a negative value for `v01`.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer v01 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the program's ability to handle the maximum value for `v01`.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer v01 = null;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the program's ability to handle a null value for `v01`.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer v01 = 999999;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the program's ability to handle a random positive value for `v01`.
