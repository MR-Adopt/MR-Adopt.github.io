## New input1:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and assigns it to the key "key1". This input tests the scenario where the `addNextNameState` method is called with a different key than the one used in the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key2";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and assigns it to the key "key2". This input tests the scenario where the `addNextNameState` method is called with a different key than the one used in the original test case.

## New input3:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key3";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and assigns it to the key "key3". This input tests the scenario where the `addNextNameState` method is called with a different key than the one used in the original test case.

## New input4:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key4";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and assigns it to the key "key4". This input tests the scenario where the `addNextNameState` method is called with a different key than the one used in the original test case.

## New input5:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key5";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `NameState` object `nextNameState` and assigns it to the key "key5". This input tests the scenario where the `addNextNameState` method is called with a different key than the one used in the original test case.
