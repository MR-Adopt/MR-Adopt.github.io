## New input1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `anotherMap` with three key-value pairs. The keys and values are of type `Integer`, which matches the type of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` being tested. The keys and values are different from the original test case, providing a different set of values to compare with the `entrySet()` method.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(10, 20);
    anotherMap.put(20, 30);
    anotherMap.put(30, 40);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `anotherMap` with three key-value pairs. The keys and values are of type `Integer`, which matches the type of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` being tested. The keys and values are different from the original test case, providing a different set of values to compare with the `entrySet()` method.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(100, 200);
    anotherMap.put(200, 300);
    anotherMap.put(300, 400);
```

## New input4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(0, 0);
    anotherMap.put(1, 1);
    anotherMap.put(2, 2);
```

## New input5:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(-1, -2);
    anotherMap.put(-2, -3);
    anotherMap.put(-3, -4);
