## Inferred Relation
The `valueOf` method takes a version string as input and splits it into major, minor, revision, and build components. The major, minor, and revision components are split using a dot as the delimiter, while the build component is split using a hyphen as the delimiter. The major, minor, revision, and build components are then used to create a new `Version` object.

Based on the given test case, it can be inferred that the `isEqual` method of the `Version` class compares the major, minor, revision, and build components of two `Version` objects and returns `true` if they are equal, and `false` otherwise.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major, minor, and revision components of `v1` and `v2` are the same ("1.0"), but the build component of `v2` is different ("A1"). Since the major, minor, and revision components are equal, the `isEqual` method should return `true` for this input pair.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major component of `v1` is "1" and the major component of `v2` is "1". The minor component of `v1` is "0" and the minor component of `v2` is "1". Since the major component of `v1` is equal to the major component of `v2`, but the minor component of `v1` is not equal to the minor component of `v2`, the `isEqual` method should return `false` for this input pair.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major component of `v1` is "1" and the major component of `v2` is "1". The minor component of `v1` is "0" and the minor component of `v2` is "1". Since the major component of `v1` is equal to the major component of `v2`, but the minor component of `v1` is not equal to the minor component of `v2`, the `isEqual` method should return `false` for this input pair.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "2.0";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major component of `v1` is "1" and the major component of `v2` is "2". Since the major components are not equal, the `isEqual` method should return `false` for this input pair.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "2.0-A1";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major component of `v1` is "1" and the major component of `v2` is "2". Since the major components are not equal, the `isEqual` method should return `false` for this input pair.
