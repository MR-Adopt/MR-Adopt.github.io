## New input pair0:
```java
    String name = "headache";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module1";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "module1";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `symptom` and `symptom2` are referring to the same object. The `addressSource` method is called with the same `module` parameter for both `symptom` and `symptom2`, ensuring that they have the same source module. This is similar to the original test case where `symptom` and `symptom2` are referring to the same object and `module` and `module2` are the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module2";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "module2";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);

## New input pair2:
```java

    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module3";

    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;

## New input pair3:

## New input pair4:
