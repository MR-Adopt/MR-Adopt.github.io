## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` have the same value of 0, and both `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` have the same value of "account". Therefore, when the `getBlobServiceClient` method is called with these input values, the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map will use the same key for both calls, resulting in the same `BlobServiceClient` object being returned. This ensures that the two clients are equal, as asserted in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` have the same value of 3, and both `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` have the same value of "account". Therefore, when the `getBlobServiceClient` method is called with these input values, the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map will use the same key for both calls, resulting in the same `BlobServiceClient` object being returned. This ensures that the two clients are equal, as asserted in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` have the same value of -1, and both `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` have the same value of "account". Therefore, when the `getBlobServiceClient` method is called with these input values, the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map will use the same key for both calls, resulting in the same `BlobServiceClient` object being returned. This ensures that the two clients are equal, as asserted in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account2";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account2";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` have the same value of null, and both `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` have the same value of "account2". Therefore, when the `getBlobServiceClient` method is called with these input values, the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map will use the same key for both calls, resulting in the same `BlobServiceClient` object being returned. This ensures that the two clients are equal, as asserted in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` have the same value of null, and both `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` have the same value of an empty string. Therefore, when the `getBlobServiceClient` method is called with these input values, the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map will use the same key for both calls, resulting in the same `BlobServiceClient` object being returned. This ensures that the two clients are equal, as asserted in the original test case.
