## New input pair0:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(1, 6);
    map.put(2, 6);
    map.put(3, 6);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation between the source input `anotherMap` and the follow-up input `map` is that both maps have the same key set. In the original test case, `anotherMap` has keys [5, 4, 3] and `map` has keys [5, 3, 4]. 

For the new source input, `anotherMap` has keys [1, 2, 3]. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `map` should have the same keys as `anotherMap`, but with different values. In this case, `map` has keys [1, 2, 3] and values [6, 6, 6]. This ensures that the key sets of `anotherMap` and `map` are equal, satisfying the inferred relation.
