## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `ap` and the follow-up input `type` is that the `type` should be the same as the activity type of the `ap` object.

## Explanation:
The method `addActivityParams` adds the `params` object to the `ScoringConfigGroup` object. Before adding, it checks if there is already an existing `ActivityParams` object with the same activity type as the `params` object. If there is, it removes the existing object and adds the new `params` object. The activity type is obtained using the `getActivityType()` method of the `ActivityParams` class.

In the original test case, the `addActivityParams` method is called with the `ap` object, and then the `getActivityParams` method is called with the `type` variable to retrieve the added `ActivityParams` object. The assertion checks if the retrieved object is the same as the `ap` object.

Based on this understanding, we can generate the follow-up input by setting the `type` variable to the activity type of the `ap` object.

## New input pair 0:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type2");
String type = "type2";
```
Explanation: In this case, the activity type of the `ap` object is "type2". Therefore, we set the `type` variable to "type2" to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type3");
String type = "type3";
```
Explanation: In this case, the activity type of the `ap` object is "type3". Therefore, we set the `type` variable to "type3" to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type4");
String type = "type4";
```
Explanation: In this case, the activity type of the `ap` object is "type4". Therefore, we set the `type` variable to "type4" to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type5");
String type = "type5";
```
Explanation: In this case, the activity type of the `ap` object is "type5". Therefore, we set the `type` variable to "type5" to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type6");
String type = "type6";
```
Explanation: In this case, the activity type of the `ap` object is "type6". Therefore, we set the `type` variable to "type6" to satisfy the inferred relation.
