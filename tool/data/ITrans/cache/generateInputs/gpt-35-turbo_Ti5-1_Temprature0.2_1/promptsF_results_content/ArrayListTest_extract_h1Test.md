## New input pair0:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = false;
    boolean trimFlag2 = false;
```

Explanation: 
In the original test case, the `trimFlag` is set to `false`, which means the `extractValues` method will return the entire `_data` array without any trimming. Therefore, in the new input pair, we can set `trimFlag2` to `false` as well to ensure that the extracted values are not trimmed. This will satisfy the inferred relation that when `trimFlag` is `false`, the length of the extracted values should be greater than or equal to the length of the original array.

## New input pair1:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
    boolean trimFlag2 = true;
```

Explanation: 
In the original test case, the `trimFlag` is set to `true`, which means the `extractValues` method will trim the `_data` array if it is not fully populated. In the new input pair, we can set `trimFlag2` to `true` as well to ensure that the extracted values are trimmed. This will satisfy the inferred relation that when `trimFlag` is `true`, the length of the extracted values should be less than or equal to the length of the original array.
