## New input pair0:
```java
    String str2 = "1001";
    Class<Integer> clazz = Integer.class;
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `v01` is serialized to a JSON string using the `toJSONString` method. The serialized string is then parsed back to an `Integer` object using the `parseObject` method. The `assertEquals` method is used to compare the original `v01` with the parsed `v02` to ensure they are equal.

To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we can directly assign the serialized JSON string `"1001"` to `str2` and assign `Integer.class` to `clazz`. This ensures that the parsed `v02` will be the same as the original `v01`, and the assertion in the original test case will pass.
