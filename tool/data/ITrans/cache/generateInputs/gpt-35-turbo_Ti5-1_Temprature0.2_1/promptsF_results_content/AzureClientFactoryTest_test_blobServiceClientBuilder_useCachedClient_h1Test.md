## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`retryCount1`, `ACCOUNT1`) and the follow-up inputs (`retryCount2`, `ACCOUNT2`) is that if `retryCount1` is `null`, then `retryCount2` should also be `null`. Similarly, if `ACCOUNT1` is equal to a non-empty string, then `ACCOUNT2` should be equal to the same non-empty string.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `retryCount1` is not `null`, so `retryCount2` is also not `null`. Similarly, `ACCOUNT1` is equal to a non-empty string, so `ACCOUNT2` is also equal to the same non-empty string.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `retryCount1` is not `null`, so `retryCount2` is also not `null`. Similarly, `ACCOUNT1` is equal to a non-empty string, so `ACCOUNT2` is also equal to the same non-empty string.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `retryCount1` is not `null`, so `retryCount2` is also not `null`. Similarly, `ACCOUNT1` is equal to a non-empty string, so `ACCOUNT2` is also equal to the same non-empty string.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `retryCount1` is `null`, so `retryCount2` is also `null`. Similarly, `ACCOUNT1` is an empty string, so `ACCOUNT2` is also an empty string.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "1234567890";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "1234567890";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `retryCount1` is `null`, so `retryCount2` is also `null`. Similarly, `ACCOUNT1` is equal to a non-empty string, so `ACCOUNT2` is also equal to the same non-empty string.
