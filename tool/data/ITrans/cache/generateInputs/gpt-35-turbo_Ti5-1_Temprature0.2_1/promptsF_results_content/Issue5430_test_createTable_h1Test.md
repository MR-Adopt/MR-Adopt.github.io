## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

Explanation: The `normalizeSql` method replaces all occurrences of " ( " with "(", "( " with "(", " )" with ")", "\t" with " ", "\n" with " ", "\'" with "\"", "  " with " ", ", " with ",", and " ," with ",". The `newSql` in the original test case is the expected output after applying these replacements to the `sql` input. Therefore, the new input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint, c double)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint,c double) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

Explanation: The `normalizeSql` method replaces all occurrences of " ( " with "(", "( " with "(", " )" with ")", "\t" with " ", "\n" with " ", "\'" with "\"", "  " with " ", ", " with ",", and " ," with ",". The `newSql` in the original test case is the expected output after applying these replacements to the `sql` input. Therefore, the new input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

Explanation: The `normalizeSql` method replaces all occurrences of " ( " with "(", "( " with "(", " )" with ")", "\t" with " ", "\n" with " ", "\'" with "\"", "  " with " ", ", " with ",", and " ," with ",". The `newSql` in the original test case is the expected output after applying these replacements to the `sql` input. Therefore, the new input pair2 satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

Explanation: The `normalizeSql` method replaces all occurrences of " ( " with "(", "( " with "(", " )" with ")", "\t" with " ", "\n" with " ", "\'" with "\"", "  " with " ", ", " with ",", and " ," with ",". The `newSql` in the original test case is the expected output after applying these replacements to the `sql` input. Therefore, the new input pair3 satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.RegexSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.RegexSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

Explanation: The `normalizeSql` method replaces all occurrences of " ( " with "(", "( " with "(", " )" with ")", "\t" with " ", "\n" with " ", "\'" with "\"", "  " with " ", ", " with ",", and " ," with ",". The `newSql` in the original test case is the expected output after applying these replacements to the `sql` input. Therefore, the new input pair4 satisfies the inferred relation.
