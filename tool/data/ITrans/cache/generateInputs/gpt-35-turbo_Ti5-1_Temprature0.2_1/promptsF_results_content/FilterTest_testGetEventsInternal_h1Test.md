## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `filter` and the follow-up input `filter2` is that `filter2` should have the same events as `filter`, but they should be different instances.

## New input pair 0:
```java
Filter filter = new Filter();
Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: In this case, both `filter` and `filter2` are empty filters with no events. Since there are no events in `filter`, there should be no events in `filter2` as well.

## New input pair 1:
```java
Filter filter = new Filter();
filter.add(mockEvent1);
Filter filter2 = new Filter();
filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: In this case, `filter` has one event `mockEvent1`. The follow-up input `filter2` also has one event `mockEvent1`. Both `filter` and `filter2` have the same event, but they are different instances.

## New input pair 2:
```java
Filter filter = new Filter();
filter.add(mockEvent2);
Filter filter2 = new Filter();
filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: In this case, `filter` has one event `mockEvent2`. The follow-up input `filter2` also has one event `mockEvent2`. Both `filter` and `filter2` have the same event, but they are different instances.

## New input pair 3:
```java
Filter filter = new Filter();
filter.add(mockEvent1);
filter.add(mockEvent2);
filter.add(mockEvent1);
Filter filter2 = new Filter();
filter2.add(mockEvent1);
filter2.add(mockEvent2);
filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: In this case, `filter` has three events: `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`, `mockEvent1`. The follow-up input `filter2` also has three events: `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`, `mockEvent1`. Both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events in the same order, but they are different instances.

## New input pair 4:
```java
Filter filter = new Filter();
filter.add(mockEvent2);
filter.add(mockEvent1);
filter.add(mockEvent2);
Filter filter2 = new Filter();
filter2.add(mockEvent2);
filter2.add(mockEvent1);
filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: In this case, `filter` has three events: `mockEvent2`, `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`. The follow-up input `filter2` also has three events: `mockEvent2`, `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`. Both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events in the same order, but they are different instances.
