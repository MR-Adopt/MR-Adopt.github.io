## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input (`i2cMux`, `deviceBus`) and the follow-up input (`i2cMux2`) is that when `setDeviceBus()` is called on `i2cMux` with the value of `deviceBus`, the `getDeviceBus()` method called on `i2cMux2` should return the same value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "0";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux` with the value of `deviceBus` as "0". Then, the `getDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux2`, and it should return "0" as well.

## New input pair 1:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "7";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux` with the value of `deviceBus` as "7". Then, the `getDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux2`, and it should return "7" as well.

## New input pair 2:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "3";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux` with the value of `deviceBus` as "3". Then, the `getDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux2`, and it should return "3" as well.

## New input pair 3:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "5";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux` with the value of `deviceBus` as "5". Then, the `getDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux2`, and it should return "5" as well.

## New input pair 4:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "2";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux` with the value of `deviceBus` as "2". Then, the `getDeviceBus()` method is called on `i2cMux2`, and it should return "2" as well.
