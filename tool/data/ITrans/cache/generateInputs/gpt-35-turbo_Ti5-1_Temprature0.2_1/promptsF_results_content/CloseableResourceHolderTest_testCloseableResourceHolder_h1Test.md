## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

To generate the follow-up input, we create a new `FileInputStream` object and pass it as an argument to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `CloseableResourceHolder` class is designed to hold a `Closeable` resource, and `FileInputStream` implements the `Closeable` interface.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

To generate the follow-up input, we create a new `Socket` object and pass it as an argument to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `CloseableResourceHolder` class is designed to hold a `Closeable` resource, and `Socket` implements the `Closeable` interface.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

To generate the follow-up input, we create a new `ByteArrayOutputStream` object and pass it as an argument to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `CloseableResourceHolder` class is designed to hold a `Closeable` resource, and `ByteArrayOutputStream` implements the `Closeable` interface.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new RandomAccessFile("file.txt", "rw");
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

To generate the follow-up input, we create a new `RandomAccessFile` object and pass it as an argument to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `CloseableResourceHolder` class is designed to hold a `Closeable` resource, and `RandomAccessFile` implements the `Closeable` interface.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new PipedOutputStream();
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

To generate the follow-up input, we create a new `PipedOutputStream` object and pass it as an argument to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `CloseableResourceHolder` class is designed to hold a `Closeable` resource, and `PipedOutputStream` implements the `Closeable` interface.
