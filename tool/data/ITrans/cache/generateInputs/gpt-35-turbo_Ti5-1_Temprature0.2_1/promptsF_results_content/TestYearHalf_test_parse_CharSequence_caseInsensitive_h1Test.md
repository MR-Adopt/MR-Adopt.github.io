## Inferred Relation
Based on the given original test case and the code under test, we can infer that the `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` and `half` inputs with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h1";
```
Explanation: In this case, the `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` (2000) and `half` (1) inputs with a hyphen in between, resulting in "2000-h1". This follows the inferred relation and satisfies the original test case.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2021-h2";
```
Explanation: In this case, the `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` (2021) and `half` (2) inputs with a hyphen in between, resulting in "2021-h2". This follows the inferred relation and satisfies the original test case.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1999-h1";
```
Explanation: In this case, the `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` (1999) and `half` (1) inputs with a hyphen in between, resulting in "1999-h1". This follows the inferred relation and satisfies the original test case.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2022-h2";
```
Explanation: In this case, the `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` (2022) and `half` (2) inputs with a hyphen in between, resulting in "2022-h2". This follows the inferred relation and satisfies the original test case.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year = 1970;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1970-h1";
```
Explanation: In this case, the `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` (1970) and `half` (1) inputs with a hyphen in between, resulting in "1970-h1". This follows the inferred relation and satisfies the original test case.
