## Inferred Relation
The method `listOf` in the `TypeLiteral` class creates a `TypeLiteral` object that represents a `List<T>` type, where `T` is the type specified by the input `TypeLiteral`. The method `normalize` in the `TypeLiteral` class ensures that the `TypeLiteral` object is in a normalized form by cutting references to outer objects in case of anonymous subclasses.

Based on the given test case, the inferred relation between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is that they both represent the same type, but the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is in a normalized form.

## New input pair0:
```java
    Class input = String.class;
```
FOLLOW UP INPUT:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<String>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(String.class);
```
Explanation: The `SOURCE INPUT` is `String.class`, which represents the type `String`. The `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is created using the `listOf` method with `String.class` as the input, resulting in a `TypeLiteral` object that represents the `List<String>` type. This satisfies the inferred relation because both the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` represent the same type, and the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is in a normalized form.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Class input = Double.class;
```
FOLLOW UP INPUT:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<Double>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(Double.class);
```
Explanation: The `SOURCE INPUT` is `Double.class`, which represents the type `Double`. The `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is created using the `listOf` method with `Double.class` as the input, resulting in a `TypeLiteral` object that represents the `List<Double>` type. This satisfies the inferred relation because both the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` represent the same type, and the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is in a normalized form.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Class input = Boolean.class;
```
FOLLOW UP INPUT:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<Boolean>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(Boolean.class);
```
Explanation: The `SOURCE INPUT` is `Boolean.class`, which represents the type `Boolean`. The `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is created using the `listOf` method with `Boolean.class` as the input, resulting in a `TypeLiteral` object that represents the `List<Boolean>` type. This satisfies the inferred relation because both the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` represent the same type, and the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is in a normalized form.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Class input = Long.class;
```
FOLLOW UP INPUT:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<Long>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(Long.class);
```
Explanation: The `SOURCE INPUT` is `Long.class`, which represents the type `Long`. The `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is created using the `listOf` method with `Long.class` as the input, resulting in a `TypeLiteral` object that represents the `List<Long>` type. This satisfies the inferred relation because both the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` represent the same type, and the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is in a normalized form.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Class input = Object.class;
```
FOLLOW UP INPUT:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<Object>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(Object.class);
```
Explanation: The `SOURCE INPUT` is `Object.class`, which represents the type `Object`. The `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is created using the `listOf` method with `Object.class` as the input, resulting in a `TypeLiteral` object that represents the `List<Object>` type. This satisfies the inferred relation because both the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` represent the same type, and the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is in a normalized form.
