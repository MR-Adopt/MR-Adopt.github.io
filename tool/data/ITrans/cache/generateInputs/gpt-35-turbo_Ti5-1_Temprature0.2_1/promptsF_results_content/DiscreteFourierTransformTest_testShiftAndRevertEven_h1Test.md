## New input pair0:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(1, 1);
    original.set(0, 0, 0);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(1, 1);
    shifted2.set(0, 0, 0);
```
Explanation:
The original source input is a 1x1 matrix with a single element 0. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has only one element, the follow-up matrix should also have the same element at the same position. In this case, the follow-up input is also a 1x1 matrix with the element 0 at position (0, 0).

## New input pair1:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(3, 3);
    original.set(i, j, i + j);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(3, 3);
    shifted2.set(i, j, i + j);
```
Explanation:
The original source input is a 3x3 matrix where each element is the sum of its row and column indices. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has multiple elements, the follow-up matrix should have the same elements at the same positions. In this case, the follow-up input is also a 3x3 matrix with each element being the sum of its row and column indices.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(4, 2);
    original.set(i, j, i * j);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(4, 2);
    shifted2.set(i, j, i * j);
```
Explanation:
The original source input is a 4x2 matrix where each element is the product of its row and column indices. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has multiple elements, the follow-up matrix should have the same elements at the same positions. In this case, the follow-up input is also a 4x2 matrix with each element being the product of its row and column indices.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(2, 4);
    original.set(i, j, Math.pow(i, j));
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(2, 4);
    shifted2.set(i, j, Math.pow(i, j));
```
Explanation:
The original source input is a 2x4 matrix where each element is the result of raising its row index to the power of its column index. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has multiple elements, the follow-up matrix should have the same elements at the same positions. In this case, the follow-up input is also a 2x4 matrix with each element being the result of raising its row index to the power of its column index.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(0, 0);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(0, 0);
```
Explanation:
The original source input is an empty matrix with 0 rows and 0 columns. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix is empty, the follow-up matrix should also be empty. In this case, the follow-up input is also an empty matrix with 0 rows and 0 columns.
