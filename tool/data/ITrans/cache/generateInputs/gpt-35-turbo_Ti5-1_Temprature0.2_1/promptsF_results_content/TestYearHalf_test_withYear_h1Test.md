## Inferred Relation:
The method `YearHalf.of(year, half)` creates an instance of `YearHalf` by taking a year and a half as input. The `withYear(year)` method of `YearHalf` returns a new instance of `YearHalf` with the specified year.

Based on the given test case, it can be inferred that the `withYear(year)` method sets the year of the `YearHalf` instance to the provided year and returns a new instance with the updated year.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2005;
    int year3 = 2005;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `year1` is set to 2007, `half1` is set to 2, and `year2` is set to 2012. The `withYear(year)` method is called on `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` with `year2` as the argument. The assertion checks if the resulting `YearHalf` instance has the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`, where `year3` is set to 2012 and `half3` is set to 2.

In the new input pair, `year1` is set to 2000, `half1` is set to 1, and `year2` is set to 2005. The `withYear(year)` method is called on `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` with `year2` as the argument. The resulting `YearHalf` instance should have the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`, where `year3` is set to 2005 and `half3` is set to 1. This satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year1 = 2021;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int year3 = 2022;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `year1` is set to 2007, `half1` is set to 2, and `year2` is set to 2012. The `withYear(year)` method is called on `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` with `year2` as the argument. The assertion checks if the resulting `YearHalf` instance has the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`, where `year3` is set to 2012 and `half3` is set to 2.

In the new input pair, `year1` is set to 2021, `half1` is set to 2, and `year2` is set to 2022. The `withYear(year)` method is called on `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` with `year2` as the argument. The resulting `YearHalf` instance should have the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`, where `year3` is set to 2022 and `half3` is set to 2. This satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year1 = 1990;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1995;
    int year3 = 1995;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `year1` is set to 2007, `half1` is set to 2, and `year2` is set to 2012. The `withYear(year)` method is called on `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` with `year2` as the argument. The assertion checks if the resulting `YearHalf` instance has the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`, where `year3` is set to 2012 and `half3` is set to 2.

In the new input pair, `year1` is set to 1990, `half1` is set to 1, and `year2` is set to 1995. The `withYear(year)` method is called on `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` with `year2` as the argument. The resulting `YearHalf` instance should have the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`, where `year3` is set to 1995 and `half3` is set to 1. This satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair 3:

    int half3 = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));

Explanation: In the original test case, `year1` is set to 2007, `half1` is set to 2, and `year2` is set to 2012. The `withYear(year)` method is called on `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` with `year2` as the argument. The assertion checks if the resulting `YearHalf` instance has the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`, where `year3` is set to 2012 and `half3` is set to 2.

In the new input pair, `year1` is set to 2030, `half1` is set to 2, and `year2` is set to 2035. The `withYear(year)` method is called on `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` with `year2` as the argument. The resulting `YearHalf` instance should have the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`, where `year3` is set to 2035 and `half3` is set to 2. This satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair 4:
