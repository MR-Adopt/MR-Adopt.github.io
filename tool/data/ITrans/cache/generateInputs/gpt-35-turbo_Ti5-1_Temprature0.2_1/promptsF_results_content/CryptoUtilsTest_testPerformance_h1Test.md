## Inferred Relation
Based on the given test case and the code under test, the inferred relation between the source input `value` and the follow-up inputs `message` and `clazz` is as follows:

1. The `value` is encrypted using the `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method to generate the `encryptedValue`.
2. The `encryptedValue` is then passed as the `message` input to the `CryptoUtils.decrypt()` method.
3. The `clazz` input is used to specify the expected return type of the decrypted value.

Therefore, the follow-up inputs `message` and `clazz` should be generated based on the encrypted value of the source input `value` and the expected return type.

## New input pair 0:
```java
Long value = 0L;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input `value` is 0L. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the value and generate the `message`. The `clazz` is set to `Long.class` to indicate that the decrypted value should be of type `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.

## New input pair 1:
```java
Long value = 1L;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input `value` is 1L. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the value and generate the `message`. The `clazz` is set to `Long.class` to indicate that the decrypted value should be of type `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.

## New input pair 2:
```java
Long value = -1L;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input `value` is -1L. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the value and generate the `message`. The `clazz` is set to `Long.class` to indicate that the decrypted value should be of type `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.

## New input pair 3:
```java
Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input `value` is `Long.MAX_VALUE`. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the value and generate the `message`. The `clazz` is set to `Long.class` to indicate that the decrypted value should be of type `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.

## New input pair 4:
```java
Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input `value` is `Long.MIN_VALUE`. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the value and generate the `message`. The `clazz` is set to `Long.class` to indicate that the decrypted value should be of type `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.
