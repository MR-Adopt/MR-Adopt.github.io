## Inferred Relation
The `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method creates an instance of `YearHalf` by taking a year and a half as input. The year must be within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR`, and the half must be either 1 or 2.

The `with(Year)` method of `YearHalf` returns a new `YearHalf` instance with the year replaced by the specified year.

Based on the provided test case, it can be inferred that the `with(Year)` method replaces the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the year specified as the argument.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2000;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2005;
int year3 = 2005;
int half3 = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the year specified as the argument. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 2000 and a half of 1. When the `with(Year)` method is called with a year of 2005, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 2005. Therefore, the expected result is a `YearHalf` instance with a year of 2005 and a half of 1.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2021;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2022;
int year3 = 2022;
int half3 = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the year specified as the argument. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 2021 and a half of 2. When the `with(Year)` method is called with a year of 2022, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 2022. Therefore, the expected result is a `YearHalf` instance with a year of 2022 and a half of 2.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 1995;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 1995;
int year3 = 1995;
int half3 = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the year specified as the argument. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 1995 and a half of 1. When the `with(Year)` method is called with a year of 1995, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 1995. Therefore, the expected result is a `YearHalf` instance with a year of 1995 and a half of 1.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2020;
int year3 = 2020;
int half3 = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the year specified as the argument. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 2023 and a half of 2. When the `with(Year)` method is called with a year of 2020, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 2020. Therefore, the expected result is a `YearHalf` instance with a year of 2020 and a half of 2.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 1900;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2100;
int year3 = 2100;
int half3 = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the year specified as the argument. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 1900 and a half of 1. When the `with(Year)` method is called with a year of 2100, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 2100. Therefore, the expected result is a `YearHalf` instance with a year of 2100 and a half of 1.
