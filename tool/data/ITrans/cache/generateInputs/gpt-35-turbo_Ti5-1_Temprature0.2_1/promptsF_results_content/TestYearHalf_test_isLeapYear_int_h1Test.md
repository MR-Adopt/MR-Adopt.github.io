## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`test2`) is that the `year` and `half` values are used to create a `YearHalf` object using the `of` method. The `isLeapYear` method is then called on the `test2` object to check if the year is a leap year.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half.getValue());
```
The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a `YearHalf` object using the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values. The `half` value is obtained from the `Half` enum using the `getValue` method. The `test2` object is then used to check if the year is a leap year.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2021;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half.getValue());
```
The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a `YearHalf` object using the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values. The `half` value is obtained from the `Half` enum using the `getValue` method. The `test2` object is then used to check if the year is a leap year.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half.getValue());
```
The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a `YearHalf` object using the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values. The `half` value is obtained from the `Half` enum using the `getValue` method. The `test2` object is then used to check if the year is a leap year.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1600;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half.getValue());
```
The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a `YearHalf` object using the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values. The `half` value is obtained from the `Half` enum using the `getValue` method. The `test2` object is then used to check if the year is a leap year.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2024;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half.getValue());
```
The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a `YearHalf` object using the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values. The `half` value is obtained from the `Half` enum using the `getValue` method. The `test2` object is then used to check if the year is a leap year.
