## Inferred Relation
The `isHigherThan` method in the `Version` class compares two versions and returns `true` if the first version is higher than the second version. The comparison is done based on the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of the versions.

The `valueOf` method in the `Version` class parses a version string and constructs a `Version` object. The version string can have the following formats:
- `major`
- `major-minor`
- `major-minor-revision`
- `major-minor-revision-build`

The `valueOf` method splits the version string using regular expressions and extracts the major, minor, revision, and build numbers. It then creates a new `Version` object with these numbers.

## Explanation
Based on the `valueOf` method, we can infer that the major, minor, revision, and build numbers are extracted from the version string in a specific order. The major number is always extracted first, followed by the minor number, revision number, and build number.

To generate the follow-up input for each new source input, we need to construct a version string that has the same major, minor, revision, and build numbers as the source input, but with different values.

For example, for the new source input `v1 = "1.0-A1"`, we can construct the follow-up input `v2 = "1.0-A2"`. This follow-up input has the same major, minor, and revision numbers as the source input, but with a different build number.

Similarly, for the new source input `v1 = "1.1.0"`, we can construct the follow-up input `v2 = "1.1.1"`. This follow-up input has the same major and minor numbers as the source input, but with a different revision number.

We can apply the same logic to generate follow-up inputs for the other new source inputs.

## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.10";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the major number of `v1` is the same as the major number of `v2`, but the minor number of `v2` is higher than the minor number of `v1`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the major and minor numbers of `v1` are the same as the major and minor numbers of `v2`, but the revision number of `v2` is higher than the revision number of `v1`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the major, minor, and revision numbers of `v1` are the same as the major, minor, and revision numbers of `v2`, but the build number of `v2` is higher than the build number of `v1`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0";
    String v2 = "2.1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the major number of `v1` is the same as the major number of `v2`, but the minor number of `v2` is higher than the minor number of `v1`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0-A1";
    String v2 = "2.0-A2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the major and minor numbers of `v1` are the same as the major and minor numbers of `v2`, but the build number of `v2` is higher than the build number of `v1`.
