## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `job2Detail` and the follow-up input `job22` is that the `job22` is the key of the job detail object `job2Detail`.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `job2Detail` is added to the scheduler using the `addJob` method. Then, the `getJobDetail` method is called with the `job22` key to retrieve the job detail object. The assertion checks if the retrieved job detail object is equal to the `job2Detail`.

Based on this observation, we can infer that the `job22` key is the key of the `job2Detail` object. Therefore, the follow-up input should be constructed by creating a new `JobKey` object with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` object.

## New input pair 0:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` object.

## New input pair 1:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` object.

## New input pair 2:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", "group2")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", "group2");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` object.

## New input pair 3:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job4", "group3")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job4", "group3");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` object.

## New input pair 4:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job5", "group4")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job5", "group4");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` object.
