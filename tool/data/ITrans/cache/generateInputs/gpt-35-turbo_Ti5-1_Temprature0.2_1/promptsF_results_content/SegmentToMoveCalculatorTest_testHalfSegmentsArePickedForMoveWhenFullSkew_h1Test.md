## New input pair0:
```java
    String tier = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

Explanation: 
The follow-up input `tier2` and `historicals2` are the same as the source input `tier` and `historicals`. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to ensure that there is no limit on the maximum number of segments allowed to be moved in the tier. This satisfies the inferred relation that when the `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to a large value, the number of segments to move in the tier should be equal to the number of segments needed to fix the skew between the historicals in the tier.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

Explanation: 
The follow-up input `tier2` and `historicals2` are the same as the source input `tier` and `historicals`. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to ensure that there is no limit on the maximum number of segments allowed to be moved in the tier. Since there are no segments in the historicals, the number of segments to move in the tier should be 0. This satisfies the inferred relation that when there are no segments in the historicals, the number of segments to move in the tier should be 0.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

Explanation: 
The follow-up input `tier2` and `historicals2` are the same as the source input `tier` and `historicals`. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to ensure that there is no limit on the maximum number of segments allowed to be moved in the tier. Since all the historicals have the same number of segments, the number of segments to move in the tier should be 0. This satisfies the inferred relation that when all the historicals have the same number of segments, the number of segments to move in the tier should be 0.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", Collections.emptyList()));
    String tier2 = "tier1";

The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to ensure that there is no limit on the maximum number of segments allowed to be moved in the tier.
