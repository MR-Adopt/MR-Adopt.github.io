## New input pair0:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
    String token2 = "b";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `token1` and `token2` have the same value of "b", which means they are equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String token1 = "";
    String token2 = "";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `token1` and `token2` are empty strings, which means they are equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String token1 = "abc";
    String token2 = "abc";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `token1` and `token2` have the same value of "abc", which means they are equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String token1 = "A";
    String token2 = "A";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `token1` and `token2` have the same value of "A", which means they are equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String token1 = "1";
    String token2 = "1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `token1` and `token2` have the same value of "1", which means they are equal.
