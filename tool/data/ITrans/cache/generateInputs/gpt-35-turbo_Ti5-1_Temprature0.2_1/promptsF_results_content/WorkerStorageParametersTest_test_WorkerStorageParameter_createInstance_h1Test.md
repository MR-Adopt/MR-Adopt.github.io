## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up inputs `l2` and `b` is as follows:
- If `l` is greater than 0 and `b` is true, then `l2` should be equal to `l` and the assertion in the original test case should pass.
- If `l` is less than or equal to 0 or `b` is false, then `l2` should be -1 and the assertion in the original test case should pass.

## New input pair0:
```java
long l = 0;
long l2 = -1;
boolean b = false;
```
Explanation: In this case, `l` is less than or equal to 0 and `b` is false. According to the inferred relation, `l2` should be -1. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case should pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
long l2 = -1;
boolean b = false;
```
Explanation: In this case, `l` is greater than 0 and `b` is false. According to the inferred relation, `l2` should be -1. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case should pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
long l = 100000000;
long l2 = 100000000;
boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In this case, `l` is greater than 0 and `b` is true. According to the inferred relation, `l2` should be equal to `l`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case should pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
long l = -1;
long l2 = -1;
boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In this case, `l` is less than or equal to 0 and `b` is true. According to the inferred relation, `l2` should be -1. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case should pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
long l = 500000000;
long l2 = 500000000;
boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In this case, `l` is greater than 0 and `b` is true. According to the inferred relation, `l2` should be equal to `l`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation and the assertion in the original test case should pass.

## Code to generate follow-up inputs:
```java
// New source input0
long l0 = 0;
long l2_0 = -1;
boolean b0 = false;

// New source input1
long l1 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
long l2_1 = -1;
boolean b1 = false;

// New source input2
long l2 = 100000000;
long l2_2 = 100000000;
boolean b2 = true;

// New source input3
long l3 = -1;
long l2_3 = -1;
boolean b3 = true;

// New source input4
long l4 = 500000000;
long l2_4 = 500000000;
boolean b4 = true;
```

The follow-up inputs are generated based on the inferred relation. For each new source input, the corresponding follow-up inputs are constructed to satisfy the inferred relation and pass the assertions in the original test case.
