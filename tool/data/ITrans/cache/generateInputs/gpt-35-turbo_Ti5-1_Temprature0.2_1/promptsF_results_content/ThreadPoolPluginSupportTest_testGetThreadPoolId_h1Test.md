## Inferred Relation:
The method `getThreadPoolId()` returns the thread-pool id of the `executor` object. The `support` object is created using the same thread-pool id as the `executor` object. Therefore, the `support.getThreadPoolId()` should return the same thread-pool id as `executor.getThreadPoolId()`.

## New input pair0:
```java
@Test
public void testGetThreadPoolId() {
    ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
    ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
    Assert.assertEquals(executor.getThreadPoolId(), support.getThreadPoolId());

    // New source input
    ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor newExecutor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("newTest", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
    ThreadPoolPluginSupport newSupport = new TestSupport(newExecutor.getThreadPoolId(), newExecutor, manager);
    Assert.assertEquals(newExecutor.getThreadPoolId(), newSupport.getThreadPoolId());
}
```

Explanation: 
In the new input pair, a new `executor` object is created with different parameters. The `support` object is created using the thread-pool id of the new `executor` object. The assertion checks that the thread-pool id of the new `executor` object is equal to the thread-pool id of the new `support` object. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `support.getThreadPoolId()` should return the same thread-pool id as `executor.getThreadPoolId()`.
