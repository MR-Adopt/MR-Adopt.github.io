## Inferred Relation
The `encode` method encodes a given string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string by first encoding the input string using Base64 encoding and then replacing a specific character with a replacement character. The `decode` method decodes a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string into its original string representation by first replacing the replacement character with the specific character and then decoding the string using Base64 decoding.

Based on the provided test case, the inferred relation between the source input (`input`) and the follow-up input (`encoded2`) is that the `encoded2` is the result of encoding the `input` string using the `encode` method.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String input = "";
String encoded2 = "";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because an empty string, when encoded using the `encode` method, will result in an empty string as the output. Therefore, the `encoded2` value is also an empty string.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String input = "1234567890";
String encoded2 = "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MA==";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `input` string, when encoded using the `encode` method, will result in the `encoded2` value. The `encode` method encodes the input string using Base64 encoding, which converts each character into its corresponding Base64 representation. In this case, the input string "1234567890" is encoded as "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MA==".

## New input pair 2:
```java
String input = "Hello, World!";
String encoded2 = "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `input` string, when encoded using the `encode` method, will result in the `encoded2` value. The `encode` method encodes the input string using Base64 encoding, which converts each character into its corresponding Base64 representation. In this case, the input string "Hello, World!" is encoded as "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==".

## New input pair 3:
```java
String input = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
String encoded2 = "YWJjZGVmZ2hpamtsbW5vcHFyc3R1dnd4eXo=";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `input` string, when encoded using the `encode` method, will result in the `encoded2` value. The `encode` method encodes the input string using Base64 encoding, which converts each character into its corresponding Base64 representation. In this case, the input string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" is encoded as "YWJjZGVmZ2hpamtsbW5vcHFyc3R1dnd4eXo=".

## New input pair 4:
```java
String input = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
String encoded2 = "QUJDREVGR0hJSktMTU5PUFFSU1RVVldYWVo=";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `input` string, when encoded using the `encode` method, will result in the `encoded2` value. The `encode` method encodes the input string using Base64 encoding, which converts each character into its corresponding Base64 representation. In this case, the input string "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" is encoded as "QUJDREVGR0hJSktMTU5PUFFSU1RVVldYWVo=".

The follow-up inputs were generated by applying the `encode` method to the corresponding source inputs. The `encode` method encodes the source input using Base64 encoding and replaces a specific character with a replacement character. The resulting encoded string is the follow-up input.
