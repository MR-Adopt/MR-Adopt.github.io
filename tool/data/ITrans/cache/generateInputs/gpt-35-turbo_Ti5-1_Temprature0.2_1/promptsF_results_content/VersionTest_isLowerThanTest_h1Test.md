## Inferred Relation
Based on the given test case and the code under test, it can be inferred that the `isLowerThan` method of the `Version` class compares two `Version` objects and returns `true` if the first version is lower than the second version.

The comparison is done by comparing the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of the two versions in a hierarchical manner. The major number is compared first, followed by the minor number, revision number, and build number.

If any of the numbers are different between the two versions, the comparison stops at that level and the result is determined based on the comparison of that number. If all the numbers are the same, the result is determined based on the presence of a build number. A version with a build number is considered higher than a version without a build number.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String v1 = "0.1";
String v2 = "0.2";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major number of `v1` is 0 and the major number of `v2` is also 0. Since the major numbers are the same, the comparison moves to the minor numbers. The minor number of `v1` is 1 and the minor number of `v2` is 2. Since the minor number of `v1` is lower than the minor number of `v2`, the result of the comparison should be `true`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String v1 = "2.0.0";
String v2 = "1.10";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major number of `v1` is 2 and the major number of `v2` is 1. Since the major number of `v1` is higher than the major number of `v2`, the result of the comparison should be `false`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String v1 = "1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.0";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major number of `v1` is 1 and the major number of `v2` is also 1. Since the major numbers are the same, the comparison moves to the minor numbers. Since `v2` does not have a minor number, the comparison stops at the major number level and the result of the comparison should be `false`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.1";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major number of `v1` is 1 and the major number of `v2` is also 1. Since the major numbers are the same, the comparison moves to the minor numbers. The minor number of `v1` is 1 and the minor number of `v2` is 1. Since the minor numbers are the same, the comparison moves to the revision numbers. Since `v2` does not have a revision number, the comparison stops at the minor number level and the result of the comparison should be `false`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.0";
```
Explanation: In this case, the major number of `v1` is 1 and the major number of `v2` is also 1. Since the major numbers are the same, the comparison moves to the minor numbers. The minor number of `v1` is 0 and the minor number of `v2` is 0. Since the minor numbers are the same, the comparison moves to the revision numbers. The revision number of `v1` is 0 and the revision number of `v2` is null. Since `v2` does not have a revision number, the comparison stops at the minor number level and the result of the comparison should be `false`.
