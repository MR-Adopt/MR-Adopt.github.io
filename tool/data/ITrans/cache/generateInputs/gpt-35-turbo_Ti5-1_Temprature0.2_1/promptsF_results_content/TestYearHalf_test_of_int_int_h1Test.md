## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_YEAR;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it uses the minimum valid year value and the first half of the year. The `YearHalf.of()` method is expected to create a `YearHalf` object with the specified year and half values. The `assertEquals(half, test2.getHalfValue())` assertion in the original test case verifies that the `getHalfValue()` method returns the correct half value for the `YearHalf` object. By using the same year and half values, the assertion will pass for this new input pair.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = Year.MAX_YEAR;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it uses the maximum valid year value and the second half of the year. The `YearHalf.of()` method is expected to create a `YearHalf` object with the specified year and half values. The `assertEquals(half, test2.getHalfValue())` assertion in the original test case verifies that the `getHalfValue()` method returns the correct half value for the `YearHalf` object. By using the same year and half values, the assertion will pass for this new input pair.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it uses a specific year value (2022) and the first half of the year. The `YearHalf.of()` method is expected to create a `YearHalf` object with the specified year and half values. The `assertEquals(half, test2.getHalfValue())` assertion in the original test case verifies that the `getHalfValue()` method returns the correct half value for the `YearHalf` object. By using the same year and half values, the assertion will pass for this new input pair.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2023;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it uses a specific year value (2023) and the second half of the year. The `YearHalf.of()` method is expected to create a `YearHalf` object with the specified year and half values. The `assertEquals(half, test2.getHalfValue())` assertion in the original test case verifies that the `getHalfValue()` method returns the correct half value for the `YearHalf` object. By using the same year and half values, the assertion will pass for this new input pair.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it uses a specific year value (2000) and the second half of the year. The `YearHalf.of()` method is expected to create a `YearHalf` object with the specified year and half values. The `assertEquals(half, test2.getHalfValue())` assertion in the original test case verifies that the `getHalfValue()` method returns the correct half value for the `YearHalf` object. By using the same year and half values, the assertion will pass for this new input pair.
