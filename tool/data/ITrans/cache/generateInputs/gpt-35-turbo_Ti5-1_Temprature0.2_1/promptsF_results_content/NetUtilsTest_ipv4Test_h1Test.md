## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 192168000001L;
```
To generate the follow-up input `ipLong2`, we can convert the IP address `192.168.0.1` to its corresponding long value. The long value can be obtained by multiplying each octet of the IP address by the corresponding power of 1,000 and summing them up. In this case, `192 * 1_000_000_000 + 168 * 1_000_000 + 0 * 1_000 + 1 = 192168000001`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because when we convert `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method, it should return the same IP address `192.168.0.1`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 100000000001L;
```
To generate the follow-up input `ipLong2`, we can convert the IP address `10.0.0.1` to its corresponding long value. The long value can be obtained by multiplying each octet of the IP address by the corresponding power of 1,000 and summing them up. In this case, `10 * 1_000_000_000 + 0 * 1_000_000 + 0 * 1_000 + 1 = 100000000001`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because when we convert `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method, it should return the same IP address `10.0.0.1`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 172016000001L;
```
To generate the follow-up input `ipLong2`, we can convert the IP address `172.16.0.1` to its corresponding long value. The long value can be obtained by multiplying each octet of the IP address by the corresponding power of 1,000 and summing them up. In this case, `172 * 1_000_000_000 + 16 * 1_000_000 + 0 * 1_000 + 1 = 172016000001`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because when we convert `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method, it should return the same IP address `172.16.0.1`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "255.255.255.255";
    long ipLong2 = 255255255255L;
```
To generate the follow-up input `ipLong2`, we can convert the IP address `255.255.255.255` to its corresponding long value. The long value can be obtained by multiplying each octet of the IP address by the corresponding power of 1,000 and summing them up. In this case, `255 * 1_000_000_000 + 255 * 1_000_000 + 255 * 1_000 + 255 = 255255255255`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because when we convert `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method, it should return the same IP address `255.255.255.255`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "0.0.0.0";
    long ipLong2 = 0L;
```
To generate the follow-up input `ipLong2`, we can convert the IP address `0.0.0.0` to its corresponding long value. The long value can be obtained by multiplying each octet of the IP address by the corresponding power of 1,000 and summing them up. In this case, `0 * 1_000_000_000 + 0 * 1_000_000 + 0 * 1_000 + 0 = 0`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because when we convert `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method, it should return the same IP address `0.0.0.0`.
