## New input pair0:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 1);
```

Explanation: 
Based on the original test case, the length of the year is determined by whether the year is a leap year or not. In the original test case, the year is set to 500, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. 

To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we can choose a new year, such as 2020, which is a leap year. We can then create a new `YearHalf` object using the `of()` method with the new year and any valid half value. In this case, we choose 1 as the half value. 

By doing so, the follow-up input `test2` will have the same length of the year as the original test case, which is 366 for a leap year.
