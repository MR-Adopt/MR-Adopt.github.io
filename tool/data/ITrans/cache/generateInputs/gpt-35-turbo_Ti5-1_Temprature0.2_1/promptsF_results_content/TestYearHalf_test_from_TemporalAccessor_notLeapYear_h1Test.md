In the original test case, the `date` object is used to calculate the `expected` value. The `expected` value is calculated by taking the month value of the `date`, subtracting 1, dividing by 6, and adding 1. This value is then used to create a `YearHalf` object using the `YearHalf.of(year, expected)` method.

Based on this information, we can infer that the `expected` value is derived from the month value of the `date` object. The `expected` value represents the half of the year that the `date` falls into.

To generate a follow-up input for a new `date` object, we can use the same logic to calculate the `expected` value based on the month value of the `date`. The `year` value can be any valid year.

Here is an example of a new input pair:

## New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

In this example, the `date` object is set to July 1, 2022. The `expected` value is calculated as ((7 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 2, indicating that the `date` falls into the second half of the year. The `year` value is set to 2022.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date`, and the `year` value can be any valid year.
