## New input pair0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same key, value, and bias as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `element` has the key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `element2` should have the same key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. This ensures that the `remove` method will remove the element with the same key, value, and bias from the set.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same key, value, and bias as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `element` has the key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `element2` should have the same key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. This ensures that the `remove` method will remove the element with the same key, value, and bias from the set.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same key, value, and bias as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `element` has the key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `element2` should have the same key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. This ensures that the `remove` method will remove the element with the same key, value, and bias from the set.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same key, value, and bias as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `element` has the key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `element2` should have the same key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. This ensures that the `remove` method will remove the element with the same key, value, and bias from the set.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, null);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, null);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same key, value, and bias as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `element` has the key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `element2` should have the same key "key1", value 1, and bias `bias`. This ensures that the `remove` method will remove the element with the same key, value, and bias from the set.
