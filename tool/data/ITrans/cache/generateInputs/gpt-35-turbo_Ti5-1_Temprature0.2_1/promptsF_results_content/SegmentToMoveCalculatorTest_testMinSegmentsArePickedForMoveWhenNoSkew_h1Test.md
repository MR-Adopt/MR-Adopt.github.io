## Inferred Relation:
The relation between the source inputs (`totalSegmentsInTier`) and the follow-up inputs (`tier`, `historicals`, `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier`) is that the `totalSegmentsInTier` value is used to calculate the minimum number of segments to move in a tier (`minSegmentsToMove`). This minimum value is then used along with other inputs (`tier`, `historicals`, `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier`) to calculate the number of segments to move in the tier (`segmentsToMove`).

## New input pair 0:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, since `totalSegmentsInTier` is 0, the minimum number of segments to move (`minSegmentsToMove`) will be 0. Therefore, the number of segments to move in the tier (`segmentsToMove`) will also be 0. The provided follow-up inputs satisfy this relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 100;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is a small value. The minimum number of segments to move (`minSegmentsToMove`) will be the smaller of `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` and `totalSegmentsInTier`. Since `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` is not provided in the code, we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `minSegmentsToMove` will be 0. The number of segments to move in the tier (`segmentsToMove`) will be the maximum of `minSegmentsToMove` and the number of segments to move to balance the tier (`segmentsToMoveToFixDeviation`). Since `segmentsToMoveToFixDeviation` is not provided in the code, we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `segmentsToMove` will be 0. The provided follow-up inputs satisfy this relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 1_000_000;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is a large value. The minimum number of segments to move (`minSegmentsToMove`) will be the smaller of `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` and `totalSegmentsInTier`. Since `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` is not provided in the code, we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `minSegmentsToMove` will be 0. The number of segments to move in the tier (`segmentsToMove`) will be the maximum of `minSegmentsToMove` and the number of segments to move to balance the tier (`segmentsToMoveToFixDeviation`). Since `segmentsToMoveToFixDeviation` is not provided in the code, we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `segmentsToMove` will be 0. The provided follow-up inputs satisfy this relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 65_536;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is equal to 2^16, which is the threshold value for the upper bound calculation. The upper bound is calculated as `(totalSegmentsInTier >> 16) * 100`, which in this case will be 100. The minimum number of segments to move (`minSegmentsToMove`) will be the smaller of `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` and `totalSegmentsInTier`. Since `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` is not provided in the code, we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `minSegmentsToMove` will be 0. The number of segments to move in the tier (`segmentsToMove`) will be the maximum of `minSegmentsToMove` and the number of segments to move to balance the tier (`segmentsToMoveToFixDeviation`). Since `segmentsToMoveToFixDeviation` is not provided in the code, we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `segmentsToMove` will be 0. The provided follow-up inputs satisfy this relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is a moderate value. The minimum number of segments to move (`minSegmentsToMove`) will be the smaller of `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` and `totalSegmentsInTier`. Since `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` is not provided in the code, we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `minSegmentsToMove` will be 0. The number of segments to move in the tier (`segmentsToMove`) will be the maximum of `minSegmentsToMove` and the number of segments to move to balance the tier (`segmentsToMoveToFixDeviation`). Since `segmentsToMoveToFixDeviation` is not provided in the code, we can assume it to be 0. Therefore, `segmentsToMove` will be 0. The provided follow-up inputs satisfy this relation.
