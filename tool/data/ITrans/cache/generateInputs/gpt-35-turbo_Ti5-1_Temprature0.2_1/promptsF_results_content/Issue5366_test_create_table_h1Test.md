## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 3);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is the same as the source input. The `normalizeSql` method does not modify the input string, so the original source input will already pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 2);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 2);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is similar to the source input, but with a different value for the `REMAINDER` parameter. Since the `normalizeSql` method only performs string replacements and does not modify the structure of the SQL statement, changing the value of the `REMAINDER` parameter will not affect the normalization process. Therefore, the follow-up input will still pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8 , REMAINDER 3);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is similar to the source input, but with a different value for the `MODULUS` parameter. Similar to the previous case, changing the value of the `MODULUS` parameter will not affect the normalization process. Therefore, the follow-up input will still pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3, OTHER_PARAMETER);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 3, OTHER_PARAMETER);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is the same as the source input, but with an additional parameter (`OTHER_PARAMETER`) included in the `FOR VALUES` clause. Since the `normalizeSql` method only performs string replacements and does not modify the structure of the SQL statement, adding an additional parameter will not affect the normalization process. Therefore, the follow-up input will still pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3) COMMENT 'Partitioned table';";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 3) COMMENT 'Partitioned table';";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is the same as the source input, but with a comment added at the end of the SQL statement. Since the `normalizeSql` method only performs string replacements and does not modify the structure of the SQL statement, adding a comment will not affect the normalization process. Therefore, the follow-up input will still pass the assertion in the original test case.

The inferred relation is that the `normalizeSql` method performs string replacements to normalize the input SQL statement by removing unnecessary spaces, replacing single quotes with double quotes, and ensuring consistent spacing around parentheses and commas. The method does not modify the structure or content of the SQL statement, so any valid SQL statement will pass the assertion in the original test case as long as it adheres to the same structure and content as the source input.
