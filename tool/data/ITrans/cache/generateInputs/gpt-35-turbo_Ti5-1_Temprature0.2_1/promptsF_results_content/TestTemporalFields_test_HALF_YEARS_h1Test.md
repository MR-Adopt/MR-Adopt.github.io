## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `quarter1`) and the follow-up inputs (`year2`, `quarter2`, `amount`) is that the follow-up inputs are used to add a certain number of quarters to the source inputs, resulting in a new `YearQuarter` object.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 2 quarters to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`) of (2023, 1), resulting in the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) of (2023, 3). The `amount` is set to 2, indicating that 2 quarters are added.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 2 quarters to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`) of (2023, 2), resulting in the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) of (2023, 4). The `amount` is set to 2, indicating that 2 quarters are added.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2024;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 2 quarters to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`) of (2023, 3), resulting in the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) of (2024, 1). The `amount` is set to 2, indicating that 2 quarters are added.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2024;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 2 quarters to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`) of (2023, 4), resulting in the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) of (2024, 2). The `amount` is set to 2, indicating that 2 quarters are added.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year1 = 2024;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2024;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 2 quarters to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`) of (2024, 1), resulting in the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) of (2024, 3). The `amount` is set to 2, indicating that 2 quarters are added.
