# Inferred Relation
Based on the given test case and the code under test, we can infer the following relation between the source inputs (`date`) and the follow-up inputs (`year` and `expected`):

1. The `year` is obtained from the `date` by extracting the year value using the `getLong(YEAR)` method.
2. The `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date`. It is calculated as `((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1`.

# New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

Explanation: 
In this new input pair, we set the `date` to `LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1)`, which represents July 1, 2022. 
The `year` is set to `2022`, which is the year extracted from the `date`.
The `expected` value is calculated as `((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1`, which evaluates to `2` since July is in the second half of the year.
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case. The `year` is obtained from the `date` and the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date`.
