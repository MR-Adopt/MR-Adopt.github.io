## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) and the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) is that `year3` should be equal to `year1` and `half3` should be equal to `half2`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2007;
int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 1;
int year3 = 2007;
int half3 = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `year3` is equal to `year1` (2007) and `half3` is equal to `half2` (1).

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2022;
int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 2;
int year3 = 2022;
int half3 = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `year3` is equal to `year1` (2022) and `half3` is equal to `half2` (2).

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 1999;
int half1 = 2;
int half2 = 2;
int year3 = 1999;
int half3 = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `year3` is equal to `year1` (1999) and `half3` is equal to `half2` (2).

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2025;
int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 1;
int year3 = 2025;
int half3 = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `year3` is equal to `year1` (2025) and `half3` is equal to `half2` (1).

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 2000;
int half1 = 2;
int half2 = 2;
int year3 = 2000;
int half3 = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `year3` is equal to `year1` (2000) and `half3` is equal to `half2` (2).
