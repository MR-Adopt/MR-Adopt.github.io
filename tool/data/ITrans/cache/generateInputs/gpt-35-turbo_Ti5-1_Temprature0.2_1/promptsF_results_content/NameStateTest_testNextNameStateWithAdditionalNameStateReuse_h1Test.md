## New input pair0:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is the same as the source input pair in the original test case. It satisfies the inferred relation because the `nameState2` is assigned the same reference as `nameState`, which means they both refer to the same `NameState` object. Similarly, `key` and `key2` have the same value, so they refer to the same key in the `keyToNextNameState` map. Therefore, calling `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the `nextNameState` object that was added using `nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState)`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
    String key2 = "key1";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is similar to the previous one, but with different key values. It satisfies the inferred relation because `nameState2` is assigned the same reference as `nameState`, and `key` and `key2` have the same value. Therefore, calling `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the `nextNameState` object that was added using `nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState)`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key3";
    String key2 = "key3";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is similar to the previous one, but with different key values. It satisfies the inferred relation because `nameState2` is assigned the same reference as `nameState`, and `key` and `key2` have the same value. Therefore, calling `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the `nextNameState` object that was added using `nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState)`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key4";
    String key2 = "key4";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is similar to the previous ones, but with different key values. It satisfies the inferred relation because `nameState2` is assigned the same reference as `nameState`, and `key` and `key2` have the same value. Therefore, calling `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the `nextNameState` object that was added using `nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState)`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key5";
    String key2 = "key5";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is similar to the previous ones, but with different key values. It satisfies the inferred relation because `nameState2` is assigned the same reference as `nameState`, and `key` and `key2` have the same value. Therefore, calling `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the `nextNameState` object that was added using `nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState)`.
