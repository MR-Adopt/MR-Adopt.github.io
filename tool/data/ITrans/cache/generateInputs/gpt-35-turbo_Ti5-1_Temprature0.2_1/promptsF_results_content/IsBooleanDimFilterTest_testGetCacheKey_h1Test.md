## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `f3` and the follow-up input `f4` is that they have the same values for the `field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` properties.

## New input pair 0:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "", null);
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same values for the `field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` properties as the source input `f3`. This ensures that both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for these properties, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same values for the `field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` properties as the source input `f3`. This ensures that both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for these properties, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same values for the `field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` properties as the source input `f3`. This ensures that both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for these properties, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.LONG, 123, null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.LONG, 123, null);
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same values for the `field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` properties as the source input `f3`. This ensures that both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for these properties, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same values for the `field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` properties as the source input `f3`. This ensures that both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for these properties, satisfying the inferred relation.
