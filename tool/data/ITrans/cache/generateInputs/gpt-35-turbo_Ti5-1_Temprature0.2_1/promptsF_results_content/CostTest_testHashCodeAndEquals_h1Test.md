## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` and `other` objects have different values for the `value` field. To satisfy this condition, we can set the `subject` object to have a value of 0 and the `other` object to have a value of 1.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` and `other` objects have different values for the `value` field. To satisfy this condition, we can set the `subject` object to have the maximum possible value (Integer.MAX_VALUE) and the `other` object to have the minimum possible value (Integer.MIN_VALUE).

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-10);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-11);
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` and `other` objects have different values for the `value` field. To satisfy this condition, we can set the `subject` object to have a negative value (-10) and the `other` object to have a smaller negative value (-11).

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000001);
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` and `other` objects have different values for the `value` field. To satisfy this condition, we can set the `subject` object to have a value of 1000000 and the `other` object to have a value of 1000001.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` and `other` objects have different values for the `value` field. To satisfy this condition, we can set the `subject` object to have the minimum possible value (Integer.MIN_VALUE) and the `other` object to have the maximum possible value (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
