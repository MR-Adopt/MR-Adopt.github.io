## Inferred Relation
The `hashCode()` method of the `AuditInfo` class uses the `Objects.hash()` method to calculate the hash code based on the values of the `author`, `identity`, `comment`, and `ip` fields. Therefore, two `AuditInfo` objects will have the same hash code if and only if their corresponding fields have the same values.

## New input pair 0:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo(null, "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo(null, "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
```
Explanation: In this case, both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same `identity`, `comment`, and `ip` values. Since the `author` field is `null` in both objects, they satisfy the inferred relation and will have the same hash code.

## New input pair 1:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", null, "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", null, "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
```
Explanation: In this case, both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same `author`, `comment`, and `ip` values. Since the `identity` field is `null` in both objects, they satisfy the inferred relation and will have the same hash code.

## New input pair 2:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", null, "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", null, "127.0.0.1");
```
Explanation: In this case, both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same `author`, `identity`, and `ip` values. Since the `comment` field is `null` in both objects, they satisfy the inferred relation and will have the same hash code.

## New input pair 3:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", null);
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", null);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same `author`, `identity`, and `comment` values. Since the `ip` field is `null` in both objects, they satisfy the inferred relation and will have the same hash code.

## New input pair 4:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.0.1");
```
Explanation: In this case, both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same `author`, `identity`, `comment`, and `ip` values. They satisfy the inferred relation and will have the same hash code.

The follow-up inputs for the new source inputs are constructed by assigning the same values to the corresponding fields in both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2`. This ensures that the inferred relation holds true and the hash codes of the objects are equal.
