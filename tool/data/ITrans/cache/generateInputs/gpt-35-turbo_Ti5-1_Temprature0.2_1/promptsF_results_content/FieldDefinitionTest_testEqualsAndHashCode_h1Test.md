## New input pair0:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `hashCode()` method is called on `subject` and `other3` objects. The `hashCode()` method returns the same value for objects with the same `name`, `type`, and `deprecated` values. In this new input pair, both `subject` and `other3` have an empty string as the `name` and `TokenType.STRING` as the `type`. The `other3` object is also deprecated, as indicated by the `deprecate()` method. Therefore, the `hashCode()` method will return the same value for both objects, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.INT);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.INT).deprecate();
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous input pair, in this new input pair, both `subject` and `other3` have the same `name` ("foo") and `TokenType.INT` as the `type`. The `other3` object is also deprecated. Therefore, the `hashCode()` method will return the same value for both objects, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, both `subject` and `other3` have the same `name` ("foo"), `TokenType.STRING` as the `type`, and are both deprecated. Therefore, the `hashCode()` method will return the same value for both objects, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition(null, TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition(null, TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, both `subject` and `other3` have `null` as the `name` and `TokenType.STRING` as the `type`. The `other3` object is also deprecated. Therefore, the `hashCode()` method will return the same value for both objects, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", null);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", null).deprecate();
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, both `subject` and `other3` have the same `name` ("foo"), `null` as the `type`, and are both deprecated. Therefore, the `hashCode()` method will return the same value for both objects, satisfying the inferred relation.
