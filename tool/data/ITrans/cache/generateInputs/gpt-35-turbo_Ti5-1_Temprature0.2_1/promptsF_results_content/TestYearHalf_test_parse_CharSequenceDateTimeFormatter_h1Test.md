## New input pair0:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2020";
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" which represents the year 2012 and the first half of the year. In the new input pair0, the `text` is "H2 2020" which represents the year 2020 and the second half of the year. The inferred relation is that the `text` should contain the year and the half of the year in the format "H{half} {year}". The follow-up input satisfies this relation and should pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H1 1999";
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" which represents the year 2012 and the first half of the year. In the new input pair1, the `text` is "H1 1999" which represents the year 1999 and the first half of the year. The inferred relation is that the `text` should contain the year and the half of the year in the format "H{half} {year}". The follow-up input satisfies this relation and should pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2022";
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" which represents the year 2012 and the first half of the year. In the new input pair2, the `text` is "H2 2022" which represents the year 2022 and the second half of the year. The inferred relation is that the `text` should contain the year and the half of the year in the format "H{half} {year}". The follow-up input satisfies this relation and should pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H1 2005";
    int year = 2005;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" which represents the year 2012 and the first half of the year. In the new input pair3, the `text` is "H1 2005" which represents the year 2005 and the first half of the year. The inferred relation is that the `text` should contain the year and the half of the year in the format "H{half} {year}". The follow-up input satisfies this relation and should pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2030";
    int year = 2030;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" which represents the year 2012 and the first half of the year. In the new input pair4, the `text` is "H2 2030" which represents the year 2030 and the second half of the year. The inferred relation is that the `text` should contain the year and the half of the year in the format "H{half} {year}". The follow-up input satisfies this relation and should pass the assertion in the original test case.
