## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input (`i2cMux`, `deviceAddress`) and the follow-up input (`i2cMux2`) is that when the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceAddress` as the parameter, the `getDeviceAddress` method should return the same `deviceAddress` value for `i2cMux2`.

## Explanation:
In the original test case, the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceAddress` as the parameter. Then, the `getDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux2` and the returned value is compared with the `deviceAddress` value. If they are equal, the test case passes.

To generate the follow-up input, we need to create a new instance of `i2cMux2` and ensure that it has the same `deviceAddress` value as `i2cMux` after calling the `setDeviceAddress` method.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x70";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
```
In this new input pair, we create a new instance of `i2cMux2` and set its `deviceAddress` to the same value as `i2cMux` after calling the `setDeviceAddress` method. This ensures that both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2` have the same `deviceAddress` value, satisfying the inferred relation.
