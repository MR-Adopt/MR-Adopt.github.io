## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is the original test case provided. It creates a table with two columns, a string and a bigint, and specifies the row format and storage format.

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the row format to DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','. This allows for different data types to be stored in the table, and it specifies the storage format as TEXTFILE.

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS ORC";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the storage format to ORC. ORC is a columnar storage format that is optimized for queries on large datasets.

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS PARQUET";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the storage format to PARQUET. Parquet is a columnar storage format that is optimized for queries on large datasets.

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS AVRO";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the storage format to AVRO. Avro is a data serialization format that is optimized for storing and transmitting large datasets.
