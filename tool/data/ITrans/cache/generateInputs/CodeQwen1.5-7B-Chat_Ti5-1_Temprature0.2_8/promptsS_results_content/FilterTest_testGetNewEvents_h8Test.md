## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `FilterEvent` with a unique event name, type, and description. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method returns a new event each time it is called.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "Type2", "Description2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates another `FilterEvent` with a different event name, type, and description. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method returns a new event each time it is called.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This input adds the same `FilterEvent` to the `Filter` twice. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method returns the same event twice each time it is called.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "Description3");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: This input creates two different `FilterEvent` objects and adds them to two different `Filter` objects. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method returns a new event each time it is called.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.remove(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This input adds a `FilterEvent` to the `Filter` and then removes it. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method does not return the removed event.
