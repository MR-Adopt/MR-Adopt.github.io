## New input1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new element with a different key ("key2") and a different value (2) to the set, which is different from the original element.

## New input2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it modifies the value of the original element ("key1") to 3, which is different from the original value (1).

## New input3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it modifies the bias of the original element ("key1") to a different value (bias + 1), which is different from the original bias.

## New input4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias - 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it modifies the bias of the original element ("key1") to a different value (bias - 1), which is different from the original bias.

## New input5:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is the same as the original element, which is a valid input for the method under test.
