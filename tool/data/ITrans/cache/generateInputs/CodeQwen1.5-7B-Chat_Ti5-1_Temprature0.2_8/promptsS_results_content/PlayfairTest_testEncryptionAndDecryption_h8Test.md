## New input1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLO";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "SECRET" from the original test case, and the plaintext "HELLO" is a common English word.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAM";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "JAVA" from the original test case, and the plaintext "PROGRAM" is a commonly used word in programming.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("TEST");
    String plaintext = "CASE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "TEST" from the original test case, and the plaintext "CASE" is a commonly used word in testing.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ENCRYPTION");
    String plaintext = "DEMO";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "ENCRYPTION" from the original test case, and the plaintext "DEMO" is a commonly used word in encryption.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ALGORITHM");
    String plaintext = "COMPUTER";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "ALGORITHM" from the original test case, and the plaintext "COMPUTER" is a commonly used word in computer science.
