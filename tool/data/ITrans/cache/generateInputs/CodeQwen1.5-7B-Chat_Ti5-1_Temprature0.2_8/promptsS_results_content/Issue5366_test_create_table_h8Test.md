## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is the original test case provided. It creates a table partition for the "orders" table with a modulus of 4 and a remainder of 3.

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 2);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus and remainder values to 5 and 2, respectively. This will create a different partition of the "orders" table.

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 3, REMAINDER 1);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus and remainder values to 3 and 1, respectively. This will create a different partition of the "orders" table.

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 0);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus and remainder values to 6 and 0, respectively. This will create a different partition of the "orders" table.

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus and remainder values to 7 and 3, respectively. This will create a different partition of the "orders" table.
