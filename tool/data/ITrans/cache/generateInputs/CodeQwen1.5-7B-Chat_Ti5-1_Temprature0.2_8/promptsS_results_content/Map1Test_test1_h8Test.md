## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "456" and the value is 456. This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from 123 to 456. This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair and that the values are different.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", 789);
    v01.put("101", 101);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the map, where the keys are "789" and "101" and the values are 789 and 101, respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least two key-value pairs.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("456", 456);
    v01.put("789", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds three new key-value pairs to the map, where the keys are "123", "456", and "789" and the values are 123, 456, and 789, respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least three key-value pairs.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("456", 456);
    v01.put("789", 789);
    v01.put("101", 101);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds four new key-value pairs to the map, where the keys are "123", "456", "789", and "101" and the values are 123, 456, 789, and 101, respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least four key-value pairs.
