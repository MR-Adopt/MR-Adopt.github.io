## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("103", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional key-value pair ("103", UUID.randomUUID()) in the map. This ensures that the map has a different size than the original input, and it also adds a new entry to the map.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input has the same keys as the original input, but it assigns a different UUID to the key "101". This ensures that the map has the same size as the original input, but it also changes the value associated with the key "101".

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes an empty string as a key in the map. This ensures that the map has a different key than the original input, and it also adds a new entry to the map.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put(null, UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes a null key in the map. This ensures that the map has a different key than the original input, and it also adds a new entry to the map.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("101", null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a null value associated with the key "101". This ensures that the map has the same size as the original input, but it also changes the value associated with the key "101".
