## New input1:
```java
UuidGenerator generator1 = new FixedUuidGenerator(UUID.fromString("550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"));
```
Explanation: This input uses a `FixedUuidGenerator` which always returns the same UUID. This is valid because the test case is checking that the generated UUIDs are different, and the `FixedUuidGenerator` will always return the same UUID.

## New input2:
```java
UuidGenerator generator2 = new SequentialUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a `SequentialUuidGenerator` which generates UUIDs in a predictable sequence. This is valid because the test case is checking that the generated UUIDs are different, and the `SequentialUuidGenerator` will always generate UUIDs in a predictable sequence.

## New input3:
```java
UuidGenerator generator3 = new NullUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a `NullUuidGenerator` which always returns `null`. This is valid because the test case is checking that the generated UUIDs are different, and the `NullUuidGenerator` will always return `null`.

## New input4:
```java
UuidGenerator generator4 = new EmptyUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses an `EmptyUuidGenerator` which always returns an empty string. This is valid because the test case is checking that the generated UUIDs are different, and the `EmptyUuidGenerator` will always return an empty string.

## New input5:
```java
UuidGenerator generator5 = new InvalidUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses an `InvalidUuidGenerator` which always throws an exception. This is valid because the test case is checking that the generated UUIDs are different, and the `InvalidUuidGenerator` will always throw an exception.
