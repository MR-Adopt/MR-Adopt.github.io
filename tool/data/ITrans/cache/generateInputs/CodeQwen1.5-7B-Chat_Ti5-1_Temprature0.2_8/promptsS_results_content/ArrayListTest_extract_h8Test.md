## New input1:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `true`, which means the method should trim the array to its size before returning it. Since the original array `a` is not trimmed, the length of the returned array `ex` should be less than or equal to the length of the original array `b`.

## New input2:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(1);
    boolean trimFlag = false;
```
Explanation: In this input, the array `a` is not empty and contains a single value `1`. The `trimFlag` is set to `false`, which means the method should return the original array without trimming. Since the original array `a` is not trimmed, the length of the returned array `ex` should be equal to the length of the original array `b`.

## New input3:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(2);
    boolean trimFlag = false;
```
Explanation: In this input, the array `a` contains two values `1` and `2`. The `trimFlag` is set to `false`, which means the method should return the original array without trimming. Since the original array `a` is not trimmed, the length of the returned array `ex` should be equal to the length of the original array `b`.

## New input4:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(2);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, the array `a` contains two values `1` and `2`. The `trimFlag` is set to `true`, which means the method should trim the array to its size before returning it. Since the original array `a` is trimmed to size, the length of the returned array `ex` should be less than or equal to the length of the original array `b`.

## New input5:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(2);
    a.appendValue(3);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, the array `a` contains three values `1`, `2`, and `3`. The `trimFlag` is set to `true`, which means the method should trim the array to its size before returning it. Since the original array `a` is trimmed to size, the length of the returned array `ex` should be less than or equal to the length of the original array `b`.
