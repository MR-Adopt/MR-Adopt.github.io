## New input1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a version with a major, minor, and revision number. It is a common format for software versioning.

## New input2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-alpha1";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a pre-release version identifier. Pre-release version identifiers are used to indicate that a version is a development or testing version and may not be ready for production use.

## New input3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-alpha1+build123";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes both a pre-release version identifier and a build metadata identifier. Build metadata is additional information about the version, such as a timestamp or a unique identifier, and it is optional.

## New input4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0+build123";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a build metadata identifier but no pre-release version identifier. It is a valid version format according to the Semantic Versioning specification.

## New input5:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-alpha1+build123.dev";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a pre-release version identifier, a build metadata identifier, and a development identifier. The development identifier is used to indicate that the version is a development version and may not be ready for production use.
