## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor1 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test1", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test1") and different core and maximum pool size (10), keep-alive time (2000L), time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), work queue (ArrayBlockingQueue with capacity 2), thread factory (Thread::new), and rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy). This input explores a valid scenario where the thread pool id is different from the original one.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor2 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test2", manager, 0, 0, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test2") and different core and maximum pool size (0), keep-alive time (0L), time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), work queue (LinkedBlockingQueue), thread factory (Thread::new), and rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy). This input explores a valid scenario where the thread pool id is different from the original one, and the core and maximum pool size are set to 0.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor3 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test3", manager, 5, 10, 500L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new PriorityBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test3") and different core and maximum pool size (5, 10), keep-alive time (500L), time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), work queue (PriorityBlockingQueue), thread factory (Thread::new), and rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy). This input explores a valid scenario where the thread pool id is different from the original one, and the work queue is a different type (PriorityBlockingQueue).

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor4 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test4", manager, 1, 1, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test4") and different core and maximum pool size (1, 1), keep-alive time (1000L), time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), work queue (SynchronousQueue), thread factory (Thread::new), and rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy). This input explores a valid scenario where the thread pool id is different from the original one, and the work queue is a different type (SynchronousQueue).

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor5 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test5", manager, 3, 5, 1500L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new DelayQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test5") and different core and maximum pool size (3, 5), keep-alive time (1500L), time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), work queue (DelayQueue), thread factory (Thread::new), and rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy). This input explores a valid scenario where the thread pool id is different from the original one, and the work queue is a different type (DelayQueue).
