## New input1:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = 0L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of valid long values (from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807) and is a common and reasonable value for encryption.

## New input2:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = 5L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of valid long values and is a common and reasonable value for encryption.

## New input3:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = -1L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of valid long values and is a common and reasonable value for encryption.

## New input4:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of valid long values and is a common and reasonable value for encryption.

## New input5:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of valid long values and is a common and reasonable value for encryption.
