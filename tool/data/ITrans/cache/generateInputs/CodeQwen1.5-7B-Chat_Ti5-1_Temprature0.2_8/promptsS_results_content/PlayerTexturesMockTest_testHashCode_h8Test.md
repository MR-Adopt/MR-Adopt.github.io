## New input1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
Explanation: This input sets a different URL for the skin, which should result in a different hashCode.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: This input sets the skin to null, which should result in a different hashCode, as null is not considered equal to any other object.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: This input sets a different URL for the cape, which should result in a different hashCode.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Explanation: This input sets the skin to the same URL twice, which should result in the same hashCode, as the URL is considered equal to itself.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: This input sets the skin to null after setting it to a different URL, which should result in a different hashCode, as null is not considered equal to any other object.
