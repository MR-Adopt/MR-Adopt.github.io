## New input1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a lambda expression that implements the `Closeable` interface. The lambda expression does not contain any code, so when the `close()` method is called, it does nothing. This is a valid implementation of the `Closeable` interface, and it can be used as a test input for the `fromCloseable` method.

## New input2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an anonymous inner class that implements the `Closeable` interface. The `close()` method is overridden to do nothing. This is a valid implementation of the `Closeable` interface, and it can be used as a test input for the `fromCloseable` method.

## New input3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an anonymous inner class that implements the `Closeable` interface. The `close()` method is overridden to throw an `IOException`. This is a valid implementation of the `Closeable` interface, and it can be used as a test input for the `fromCloseable` method.

## New input4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
```

## New input5:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
