## New input1:
```java
    String v1 = "0.9";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a lower version than the original version "1.0".

## New input2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the same version as the original version "1.0", but with an additional zero for clarity.

## New input3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a version with an additional pre-release tag, which is a common practice in versioning systems.

## New input4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0+build123";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a version with an additional build metadata, which is also a common practice in versioning systems.

## New input5:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-beta1+build456";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a version with multiple components, including a pre-release tag and build metadata, which is a more complex scenario.
