## New input1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("bar", TokenType.STRING);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the name of the field from "foo" to "bar". This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it explores a different field name.

## New input2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.INT);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the type of the field from STRING to INT. This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it explores a different field type.

## New input3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it marks the field as deprecated. This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it explores a different field state.

## New input4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses an empty string as the field name. This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it explores a different field name.

## New input5:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses null as the field type. This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it explores a different field type.
