## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(5, 1, Uniform.of(-10, 20));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 5x1 matrix with random double values between -10 and 20. This is a common scenario for Fourier transforms, and it ensures that the input data is diverse and within a reasonable range.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(10, 1, Uniform.of(-100, 200));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(10);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 10x1 matrix with random double values between -100 and 200. This is a more extreme scenario than input1, and it ensures that the input data is diverse and within a reasonable range.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(15, 1, Uniform.of(-1000, 2000));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(15);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 15x1 matrix with random double values between -1000 and 2000. This is a very extreme scenario than input1 and input2, and it ensures that the input data is diverse and within a reasonable range.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(20, 1, Uniform.of(-10000, 20000));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(20);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 20x1 matrix with random double values between -10000 and 20000. This is a very extreme scenario than input1, input2, and input3, and it ensures that the input data is diverse and within a reasonable range.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(25, 1, Uniform.of(-100000, 200000));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(25);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 25x1 matrix with random double values between -100000 and 200000. This is a very extreme scenario than input1, input2, input3, and input4, and it ensures that the input data is diverse and within a reasonable range.
