## New input1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Filter` object and adds two `FilterEventMock` objects with different names to it. This ensures that the original list of events is not modified when the `getEventsInternal` method is called.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Filter` object and adds a single `FilterEventMock` object to it. This ensures that the original list of events is not modified when the `getEventsInternal` method is called.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event1");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Filter` object and adds a single `FilterEventMock` object with a different name to it. This ensures that the original list of events is not modified when the `getEventsInternal` method is called.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock();
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.remove(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Filter` object, adds two `FilterEventMock` objects to it, and then removes one of them. This ensures that the original list of events is not modified when the `getEventsInternal` method is called.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.clear();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Filter` object, adds a `FilterEventMock` object to it, and then clears the list of events. This ensures that the original list of events is not modified when the `getEventsInternal` method is called.
