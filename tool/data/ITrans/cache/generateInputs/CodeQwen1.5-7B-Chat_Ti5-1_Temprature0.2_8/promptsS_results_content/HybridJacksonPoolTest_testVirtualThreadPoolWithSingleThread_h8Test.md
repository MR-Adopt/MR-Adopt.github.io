## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of 0, which means there will be no pooling of resources. This could be useful in scenarios where the pooling mechanism is not needed or when the pool size is determined dynamically.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of 1, which means there will be a single pooled resource that can be reused by all threads. This could be useful in scenarios where the pooling mechanism is needed but the pool size is not expected to change.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of 10, which means there will be a pool of 10 pooled resources that can be reused by all threads. This could be useful in scenarios where the pooling mechanism is needed and the pool size is expected to change dynamically.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which means there will be a pool of the maximum possible number of pooled resources that can be reused by all threads. This could be useful in scenarios where the pooling mechanism is needed and the pool size is expected to be very large.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor does not allow for a negative pool size. Therefore, this input is not a valid test input for the `acquirePooled` method.
