## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key "456" and the value "def" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", "ghi");
    v01.put("123", "jkl");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the map. The keys "789" and "123" are both strings, and the values "ghi" and "jkl" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("", "");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is an empty string, and the value is also an empty string, which are both valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put(null, "mno");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is null, and the value is a string "mno", which are both valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is a string "123", and the value is null, which are both valid entries in a HashMap.
