## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x3F";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the device address "0x3F" falls within the valid range of "0x70" - "0x77". It is a common I2C address for a device.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7F";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the device address "0x7F" falls within the valid range of "0x70" - "0x77". It is a common I2C address for a device.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the device address "0x00" is a valid I2C address. It is commonly used for testing purposes.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0xFF";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the device address "0xFF" is a valid I2C address. It is commonly used for testing purposes.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x80";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the device address "0x80" falls within the valid range of "0x70" - "0x77". It is a common I2C address for a device.
