## New input1:
```java
    Class input = String.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `listOf` is designed to create a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of a given type. By passing `String.class` as the argument, we are creating a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of `String` objects.

## New input2:
```java
    Class input = Double.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `listOf` is designed to create a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of a given type. By passing `Double.class` as the argument, we are creating a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of `Double` objects.

## New input3:
```java
    Class input = List.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `listOf` is designed to create a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of a given type. By passing `List.class` as the argument, we are creating a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of `List` objects.

## New input4:
```java
    Class input = Integer[].class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `listOf` is designed to create a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of a given type. By passing `Integer[].class` as the argument, we are creating a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of `Integer` arrays.

## New input5:
```java
    Class input = new ArrayList<Integer>().getClass();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `listOf` is designed to create a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of a given type. By passing the `Class` object of a new `ArrayList` of `Integer` objects as the argument, we are creating a `TypeLiteral` for a `List` of `Integer` objects.
