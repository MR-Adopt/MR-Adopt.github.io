## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string parameter `deviceBus` which can range from "0" to "7". By setting `deviceBus` to "0", we are testing the method's ability to handle the minimum valid value.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string parameter `deviceBus` which can range from "0" to "7". By setting `deviceBus` to "7", we are testing the method's ability to handle the maximum valid value.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string parameter `deviceBus` which can range from "0" to "7". By setting `deviceBus` to "3", we are testing the method's ability to handle a typical valid value.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string parameter `deviceBus` which can range from "0" to "7". By setting `deviceBus` to "8", we are testing the method's ability to handle an invalid value. This input should be expected to throw an exception or produce an unexpected result.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string parameter `deviceBus` which cannot be an empty string. By setting `deviceBus` to an empty string, we are testing the method's ability to handle an invalid value. This input should be expected to throw an exception or produce an unexpected result.
