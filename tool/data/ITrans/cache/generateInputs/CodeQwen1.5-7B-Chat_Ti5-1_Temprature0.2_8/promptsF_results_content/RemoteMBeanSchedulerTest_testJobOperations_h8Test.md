## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).build();
JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `JobDetail` object and its corresponding `JobKey` object have a one-to-one correspondence. In this case, the `JobDetail` object is created with the identity "job2" and group "GROUP_KEY", and the `JobKey` object is obtained from the `JobDetail` object using the `getKey()` method.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably(false).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably(false).build();
JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is the same as in the previous input pair. The only difference is that the `storeDurably(false)` method is called to set the job to be non-durable.

## New input pair2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().requestRecovery().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().requestRecovery().build();
JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is the same as in the previous input pair. The only difference is that the `requestRecovery(true)` method is called to set the job to be recoverable.

## New input pair3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().requestRecovery(false).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().requestRecovery(false).build();
JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is the same as in the previous input pair. The only difference is that the `requestRecovery(false)` method is called to set the job to be non-recoverable.

## New input pair4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).withDescription("New job description").storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).withDescription("New job description").storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is the same as in the previous input pair. The only difference is that the `withDescription("New job description")` method is called to set the job description.
