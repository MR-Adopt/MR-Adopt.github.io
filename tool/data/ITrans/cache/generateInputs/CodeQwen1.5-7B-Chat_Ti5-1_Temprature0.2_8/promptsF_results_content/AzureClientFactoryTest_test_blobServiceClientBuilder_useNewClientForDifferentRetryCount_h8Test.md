## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` should be the same. This is because the `getBlobServiceClient` method uses a `computeIfAbsent` method to cache the clients in a map. If the `retryCount` is the same, it will return the existing client from the cache. If the `retryCount` is different, it will create a new client and cache it. Therefore, if `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are the same, they will return the same client from the cache, and the assertion will pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

## New input pair2:

    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:

## New input pair3:

    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:

## New input pair4:
```java

    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
