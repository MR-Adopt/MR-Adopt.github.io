# New input pair0:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
    String token2 = "b";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is set to "b" and `token2` is set to "b", the two `append` calls should result in the same `JsonNodePath` object, which should be equal.

# New input pair1:
```java
    String token1 = "c";
    String token2 = "c";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is set to "c" and `token2` is set to "c", the two `append` calls should result in the same `JsonNodePath` object, which should be equal.

# New input pair2:
```java
    String token1 = "d";
    String token2 = "d";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is set to "d" and `token2` is set to "d", the two `append` calls should result in the same `JsonNodePath` object, which should be equal.

# New input pair3:
```java
    String token1 = "e";
    String token2 = "e";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is set to "e" and `token2` is set to "e", the two `append` calls should result in the same `JsonNodePath` object, which should be equal.

# New input pair4:
```java
    String token1 = "f";
    String token2 = "f";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is set to "f" and `token2` is set to "f", the two `append` calls should result in the same `JsonNodePath` object, which should be equal.
