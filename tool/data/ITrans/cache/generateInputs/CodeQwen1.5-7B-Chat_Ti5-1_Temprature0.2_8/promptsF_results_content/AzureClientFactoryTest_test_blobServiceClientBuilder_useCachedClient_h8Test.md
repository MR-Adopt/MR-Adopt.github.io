## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Follow-up input generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are the same, the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to 0, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are both set to "account", the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Follow-up input generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are the same, the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to 5, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are both set to "account", the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
Follow-up input generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are the same, the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to null, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are both set to "newAccount", the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
Follow-up input generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are the same, the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to 10, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are both set to "newAccount", the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Follow-up input generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are the same, the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to null, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are both set to "account", the `BlobServiceClient` should be the same.
