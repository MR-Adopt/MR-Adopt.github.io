## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = -1;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1000;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 100;
    int half = 3;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created from the `of` method should have the same year and half value as the `test2` object. This is because the `of` method takes in a year and half value and returns a `YearHalf` object. The `YearHalf` object has a `getYear` method that returns the year and a `getHalfValue` method that returns the half value. Therefore, if the `of` method is called with the same year and half value, the returned `YearHalf` object should have the same year and half value.

For the new source inputs, the `YearHalf` object is created using the `of` method with the corresponding year and half value. The `YearHalf` object is then assigned to the `test2` variable. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `test2` object has the same year and half value as the `YearHalf` object created from the `of` method.
