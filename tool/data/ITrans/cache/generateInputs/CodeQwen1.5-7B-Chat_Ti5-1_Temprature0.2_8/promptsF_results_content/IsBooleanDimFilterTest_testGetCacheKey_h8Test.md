## New input pair0:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input and the follow-up input have the same field name ("x" and "y"), the same column type (ColumnType.STRING), the same value ("hello"), and the same language (null). Since the field names are different, the cache keys will also be different.

## New input pair1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input and the follow-up input have the same field name ("x"), the same column type (ColumnType.INTEGER), the same value ("hello"), and the same language (null). Since the column types are different, the cache keys will also be different.

## New input pair2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input and the follow-up input have the same field name ("x"), the same column type (ColumnType.STRING), the same value ("world"), and the same language (null). Since the values are different, the cache keys will also be different.

## New input pair3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input and the follow-up input have the same field name ("x"), the same column type (ColumnType.STRING), the same value ("hello"), and the same language ("en"). Since the languages are different, the cache keys will also be different.

## New input pair4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "fr");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "fr");
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "fr");
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input and the follow-up input have the same field name ("x"), the same column type (ColumnType.STRING), the same value ("hello"), and the same language ("fr"). Since the languages are different, the cache keys will also be different.
