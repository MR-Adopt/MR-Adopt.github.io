## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x80";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class should set the device address of the i2cMux device and then the `getDeviceAddress` method should return the same address. Therefore, for each new source input, the corresponding follow-up input is to create a new `I2cMux` instance, set the device address using the new source input, and then assert that the device address returned by the `getDeviceAddress` method matches the new source input.
