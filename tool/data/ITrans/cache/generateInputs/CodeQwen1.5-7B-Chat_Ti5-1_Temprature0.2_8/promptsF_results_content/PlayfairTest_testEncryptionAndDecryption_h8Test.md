## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLO";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument. The follow-up input is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the `plaintext` variable as the argument. This satisfies the inferred relation because the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAM";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument. The follow-up input is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the `plaintext` variable as the argument. This satisfies the inferred relation because the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("TEST");
    String plaintext = "CASE";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument. The follow-up input is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the `plaintext` variable as the argument. This satisfies the inferred relation because the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ENCRYPTION");
    String plaintext = "DEMO";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument. The follow-up input is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the `plaintext` variable as the argument. This satisfies the inferred relation because the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ALGORITHM");
    String plaintext = "COMPUTER";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument. The follow-up input is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the `plaintext` variable as the argument. This satisfies the inferred relation because the encrypted text is obtained by calling the `encrypt` method of the `PlayfairCipher` class with the plaintext as the argument.
