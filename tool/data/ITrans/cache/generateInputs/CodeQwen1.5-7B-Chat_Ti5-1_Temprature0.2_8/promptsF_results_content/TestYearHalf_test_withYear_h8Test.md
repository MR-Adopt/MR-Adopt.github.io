# NEW INPUT PAIR0
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year3 = year2;
int half3 = half1;
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is testing the `withYear` method, which takes a year as input and returns a new `YearHalf` object with the same half-of-year, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by using the same year as the original source input.

# NEW INPUT PAIR1
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year3 = year2;
int half3 = half1;
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous input pair, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by using the same year as the original source input.

# NEW INPUT PAIR2
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year3 = year2;
int half3 = half1;
```
Explanation: As before, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by using the same year as the original source input.

# NEW INPUT PAIR3
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year3 = year2;
int half3 = half1;
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by using the same year as the original source input.

# NEW INPUT PAIR4
```java
    int year1 = 9999;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 9999;
    int year3 = 9999;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year3 = year2;
int half3 = half1;
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by using the same year as the original source input.
