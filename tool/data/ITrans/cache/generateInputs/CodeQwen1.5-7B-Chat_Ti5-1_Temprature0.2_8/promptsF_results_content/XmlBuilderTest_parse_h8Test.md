## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <MyNewProject language=\"Python\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/mynewproject/</Location>\n" + "  </MyNewProject>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the method under test is that the `parse` method should return an `XmlBuilder` object that represents the XML data parsed from the input string. The new source input `XML` contains an additional project called `MyNewProject`, which is not present in the original input `XML`. Therefore, the `parse` method should return an `XmlBuilder` object that includes the data for `MyNewProject`. The follow-up input `xmlBuilder2` is generated by calling the `parse` method with the new source input `XML`, which satisfies the inferred relation.
