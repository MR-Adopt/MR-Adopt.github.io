# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2).getHalf().getValue();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year and half of the resulting `YearHalf` object should be the same as the year and half of the initial `YearHalf` object when the half is changed. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to use the `withHalf` method to change the half of the initial `YearHalf` object and then extract the year and half of the resulting `YearHalf` object.
