## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.1.1";
    long ipLong2 = 3232235777L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should equal `ipLong2`. To satisfy this relation, we need to find the long representation of the IP address "192.168.1.1".

To achieve this, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method from the `NetUtils` class. The method takes a string representation of an IP address and returns its long representation.

The long representation of "192.168.1.1" is `3232235777L`. Therefore, we can use this value as the follow-up input `ipLong2` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 167772161L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should equal `ipLong2`. To satisfy this relation, we need to find the long representation of the IP address "10.0.0.1".

To achieve this, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method from the `NetUtils` class. The method takes a string representation of an IP address and returns its long representation.

The long representation of "10.0.0.1" is `167772161L`. Therefore, we can use this value as the follow-up input `ipLong2` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 2886729729L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should equal `ipLong2`. To satisfy this relation, we need to find the long representation of the IP address "172.16.0.1".

To achieve this, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method from the `NetUtils` class. The method takes a string representation of an IP address and returns its long representation.

The long representation of "172.16.0.1" is `2886729729L`. Therefore, we can use this value as the follow-up input `ipLong2` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "8.8.8.8";
    long ipLong2 = 134744072L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should equal `ipLong2`. To satisfy this relation, we need to find the long representation of the IP address "8.8.8.8".

To achieve this, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method from the `NetUtils` class. The method takes a string representation of an IP address and returns its long representation.

The long representation of "8.8.8.8" is `134744072L`. Therefore, we can use this value as the follow-up input `ipLong2` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "255.255.255.255";
    long ipLong2 = 4294967295L;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should equal `ipLong2`. To satisfy this relation, we need to find the long representation of the IP address "255.255.255.255".

To achieve this, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method from the `NetUtils` class. The method takes a string representation of an IP address and returns its long representation.

The long representation of "255.255.255.255" is `4294967295L`. Therefore, we can use this value as the follow-up input `ipLong2` to satisfy the relation.
