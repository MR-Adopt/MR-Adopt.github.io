## New input pair0:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Integer.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Integer.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Integer> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Integer> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `Key` objects created from the same `Class` object should be equal. Since `Integer.class` is the same as `Integer.class`, the `Key` objects created from these two `Class` objects should also be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Double.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Double.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Double> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Double> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `Key` objects created from the same `Class` object should be equal. Since `Double.class` is the same as `Double.class`, the `Key` objects created from these two `Class` objects should also be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Boolean.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Boolean.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Boolean> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Boolean> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `Key` objects created from the same `Class` object should be equal. Since `Boolean.class` is the same as `Boolean.class`, the `Key` objects created from these two `Class` objects should also be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Character.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Character.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Character> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Character> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `Key` objects created from the same `Class` object should be equal. Since `Character.class` is the same as `Character.class`, the `Key` objects created from these two `Class` objects should also be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Void.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Void.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Void> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Void> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `Key` objects created from the same `Class` object should be equal. Since `Void.class` is the same as `Void.class`, the `Key` objects created from these two `Class` objects should also be equal.
