## New input pair0:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0-alpha1";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
The follow-up input for `v = "1.0.0-alpha1"` is `version1 = Version.valueOf(v)`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class takes a string input and returns a `Version` object. The `stringOf` method of the `Version` class takes a `Version` object as input and returns a string. Therefore, if we call `stringOf(version1)` with the `version1` object we created from the input string, it will return the same string as the input string.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v = "1.1.0-beta2";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
The follow-up input for `v = "1.1.0-beta2"` is `version1 = Version.valueOf(v)`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class takes a string input and returns a `Version` object. The `stringOf` method of the `Version` class takes a `Version` object as input and returns a string. Therefore, if we call `stringOf(version1)` with the `version1` object we created from the input string, it will return the same string as the input string.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v = "2.0.0-rc3";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
The follow-up input for `v = "2.0.0-rc3"` is `version1 = Version.valueOf(v)`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class takes a string input and returns a `Version` object. The `stringOf` method of the `Version` class takes a `Version` object as input and returns a string. Therefore, if we call `stringOf(version1)` with the `version1` object we created from the input string, it will return the same string as the input string.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v = "0.9.9";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
The follow-up input for `v = "0.9.9"` is `version1 = Version.valueOf(v)`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class takes a string input and returns a `Version` object. The `stringOf` method of the `Version` class takes a `Version` object as input and returns a string. Therefore, if we call `stringOf(version1)` with the `version1` object we created from the input string, it will return the same string as the input string.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
The follow-up input for `v = "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"` is `version1 = Version.valueOf(v)`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class takes a string input and returns a `Version` object. The `stringOf` method of the `Version` class takes a `Version` object as input and returns a string. Therefore, if we call `stringOf(version1)` with the `version1` object we created from the input string, it will return the same string as the input string.
