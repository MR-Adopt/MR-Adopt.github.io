## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
int year = 2008;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object. The new input pair satisfies this relation by using the same formula to calculate the `expected` value.
