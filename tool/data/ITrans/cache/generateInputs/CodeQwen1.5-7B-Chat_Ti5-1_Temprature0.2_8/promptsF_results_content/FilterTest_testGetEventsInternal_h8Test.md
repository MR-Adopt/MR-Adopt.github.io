## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two new `Filter` objects, `filter` and `filter2`. It adds two `FilterEvent` objects, `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2`, to each filter. The `getEventsInternal()` method is then called on each filter, which returns a new `ArrayList` containing the events. Since the events are added to the filters in the same order, the internal events lists of both filters should be equal. However, since the `getEventsInternal()` method returns a new `ArrayList` containing the events, the internal events lists of the two filters are not the same object, and the `assertNotSame()` assertion fails.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two new `Filter` objects, `filter` and `filter2`. It adds a single `FilterEvent` object, `mockEvent1`, to each filter. The `getEventsInternal()` method is then called on each filter, which returns a new `ArrayList` containing the events. Since the events are added to the filters in the same order, the internal events lists of both filters should be equal. However, since the `getEventsInternal()` method returns a new `ArrayList` containing the events, the internal events lists of the two filters are not the same object, and the `assertNotSame()` assertion fails.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event1");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair2 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two new `Filter` objects, `filter` and `filter2`. It adds a single `FilterEvent` object, `mockEvent1`, to each filter. The `getEventsInternal()` method is then called on each filter, which returns a new `ArrayList` containing the events.

However, since the `getEventsInternal()` method returns a new `ArrayList` containing the events, the internal events lists of the two filters are not the same object, and the `assertNotSame()` assertion fails.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock();
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair3 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two new `Filter` objects, `filter` and `filter2`. It adds two `FilterEvent` objects, `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2`, to each filter. The `getEventsInternal()` method is then called on each filter, which returns a new `ArrayList` containing the events.
