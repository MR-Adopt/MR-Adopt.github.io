## New input pair0:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
    String key2 = "key1";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
String key = "key1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `key` and `key2` are the same, the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState.getNextNameState(key)` should also be the same as the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key2";
    String key2 = "key2";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
String key = "key2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `key` and `key2` are the same, the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState.getNextNameState(key)` should also be the same as the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key3";
    String key2 = "key3";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
String key = "key3";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `key` and `key2` are the same, the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState.getNextNameState(key)` should also be the same as the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "";
    String key2 = "";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
String key = "";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `key` and `key2` are the same, the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState.getNextNameState(key)` should also be the same as the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = null;
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
NameState nextNameState = null;
String key = "key";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `nameState2.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `nextNameState` is `null`, the `nextNameState` returned by `nameState.getNextNameState(key)` should also be `null`.
