## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```

### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the text representation of a `YearHalf` object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Since the year is 2020 and the half-of-year is 2, the text representation is "2020-h2".

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h1";
```

### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the text representation of a `YearHalf` object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Since the year is 1900 and the half-of-year is 1, the text representation is "1900-h1".

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```

### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the text representation of a `YearHalf` object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Since the year is 2000 and the half-of-year is 2, the text representation is "2000-h2".

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1800-h1";
```

### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the text representation of a `YearHalf` object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Since the year is 1800 and the half-of-year is 1, the text representation is "1800-h1".

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2100-h2";
```

### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the text representation of a `YearHalf` object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Since the year is 2100 and the half-of-year is 2, the text representation is "2100-h2".
