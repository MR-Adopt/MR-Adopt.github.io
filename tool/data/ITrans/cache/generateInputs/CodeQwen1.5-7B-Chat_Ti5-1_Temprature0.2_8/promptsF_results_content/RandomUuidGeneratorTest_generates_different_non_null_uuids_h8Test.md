# New input pair1:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new RandomUuidGenerator();
UuidGenerator generator2 = new RandomUuidGenerator();
UUID uuid1 = generator.generateId();
UUID uuid2 = generator2.generateId();
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
UuidGenerator generator2 = new RandomUuidGenerator();
UUID uuid2 = generator2.generateId();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the UUID generated by `generator` and `generator2` should be different. The new source input `generator2` satisfies this relation by creating a new `UuidGenerator` instance, which will generate a different UUID than the one generated by `generator`. The follow-up input `uuid2` is generated by `generator2`, which adheres to the inferred relation.
