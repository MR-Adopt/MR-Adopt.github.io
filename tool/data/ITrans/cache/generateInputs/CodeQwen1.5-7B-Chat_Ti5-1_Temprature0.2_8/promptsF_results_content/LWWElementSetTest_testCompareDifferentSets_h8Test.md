## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds elements to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element2` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element3 = new Element("key3", 3, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element3 = new Element("key3", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds elements to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element3` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element4 = new Element("key4", 4, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element4 = new Element("key4", 4, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds elements to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element4` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Element element5 = new Element("key5", 5, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element5 = new Element("key5", 5, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds elements to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element5` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.
