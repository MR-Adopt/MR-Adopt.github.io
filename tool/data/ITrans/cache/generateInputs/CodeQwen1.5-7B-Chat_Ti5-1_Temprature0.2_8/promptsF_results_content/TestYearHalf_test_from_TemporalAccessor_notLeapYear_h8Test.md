## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2007, 1, 1);
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
    YearHalf test = YearHalf.from(date);
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year, expected), test);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `expected` values are derived from the `date` object. The `from` method in the `YearHalf` class takes a `TemporalAccessor` as input and returns a `YearHalf` object. The `date` object is used to extract the year and half-of-year fields, which are then used to create a new `YearHalf` object. The `assertEquals` method is used to verify that the `YearHalf` object created from the `date` object matches the expected `YearHalf` object. Therefore, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
