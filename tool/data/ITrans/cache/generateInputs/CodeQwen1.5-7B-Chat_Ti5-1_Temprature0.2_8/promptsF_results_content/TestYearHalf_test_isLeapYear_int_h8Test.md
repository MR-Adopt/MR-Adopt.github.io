## New input pair0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `of` is dependent on the input parameters `year` and `half`. Since the input parameters `year` and `half` are different for the new source input, the output of the method `of` will also be different. Therefore, the new source input `year = 2000` and `half = Half.H2` satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 1900;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 1900;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `of` is dependent on the input parameters `year` and `half`. Since the input parameters `year` and `half` are different for the new source input, the output of the method `of` will also be different. Therefore, the new source input `year = 1900` and `half = Half.H1` satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1901;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1901;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `of` is dependent on the input parameters `year` and `half`. Since the input parameters `year` and `half` are different for the new source input, the output of the method `of` will also be different. Therefore, the new source input `year = 1901` and `half = Half.H2` satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2100;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2100;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `of` is dependent on the input parameters `year` and `half`. Since the input parameters `year` and `half` are different for the new source input, the output of the method `of` will also be different. Therefore, the new source input `year = 2100` and `half = Half.H1` satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2101;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2101;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `of` is dependent on the input parameters `year` and `half`. Since the input parameters `year` and `half` are different for the new source input, the output of the method `of` will also be different.
