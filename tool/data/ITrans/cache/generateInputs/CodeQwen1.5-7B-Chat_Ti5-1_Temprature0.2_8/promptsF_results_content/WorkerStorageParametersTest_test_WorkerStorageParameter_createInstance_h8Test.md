## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. In this case, the source input is `l = 0`, so the follow-up input should also be `l = 0`. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and is set to `false` as a default value.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. In this case, the source input is `l = -1`, so the follow-up input should also be `l = -1`. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and is set to `false` as a default value.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. In this case, the source input is `l = Long.MAX_VALUE`, so the follow-up input should also be `l = Long.MAX_VALUE`. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and is set to `false` as a default value.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = 1;
    long l2 = 1;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. In this case, the source input is `l = 1`, so the follow-up input should also be `l = 1`. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and is set to `false` as a default value.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = -1000000000;
    long l2 = -1000000000;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. In this case, the source input is `l = -1000000000`, so the follow-up input should also be `l = -1000000000`. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and is set to `false` as a default value.
