# NEW INPUT PAIR1
```java
    String element2 = "B";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
String element2 = "B";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the 'element' in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' is different from the 'element2' in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST'. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to add a different element to the 'ORSet' in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST'. In this case, we add the element "B" to the 'ORSet'.

# NEW INPUT PAIR2
```java
    String element2 = "C";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
String element2 = "C";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the 'element' in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' is different from the 'element2' in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST'. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to add a different element to the 'ORSet' in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST'. In this case, we add the element "C" to the 'ORSet'.

# NEW INPUT PAIR3
```java
    String element2 = "D";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
String element2 = "D";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the 'element' in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' is different from the 'element2' in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST'. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to add a different element to the 'ORSet' in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST'. In this case, we add the element "D" to the 'ORSet'.
