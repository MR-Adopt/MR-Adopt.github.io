## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha1";
    String v2 = "1.0-alpha2";
```
Follow-up input generation:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha1";
    String v2 = "1.0-alpha2";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version with the higher number of digits should be considered higher. Since "1.0-alpha1" has fewer digits than "1.0-alpha2", it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Follow-up input generation:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version with the higher number of digits should be considered higher. Since "1.0.0" has fewer digits than "1.0.1", it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-beta1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-beta2";
```
Follow-up input generation:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-beta1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-beta2";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version with the higher number of digits should be considered higher. Since "1.0.0-beta1" has fewer digits than "1.0.0-beta2", it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0+build123";
    String v2 = "1.0.0+build124";
```
Follow-up input generation:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0+build123";
    String v2 = "1.0.0+build124";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version with the higher number of digits should be considered higher. Since "1.0.0+build123" has fewer digits than "1.0.0+build124", it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-alpha1+build123";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-alpha1+build124";
```
Follow-up input generation:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-alpha1+build123";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-alpha1+build124";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version with the higher number of digits should be considered higher. Since "1.0.0-alpha1+build123" has fewer digits than "1.0.0-alpha1+build124", it satisfies the inferred relation.
