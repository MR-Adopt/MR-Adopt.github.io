## New input pair0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source and follow-up inputs is that the `element` and `element2` have the same key and bias. Since the original test case removes `element2` from the set, we need to ensure that the `element2` has the same key and bias as `element` to satisfy the condition of the test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 3, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 3, bias);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source and follow-up inputs is that the `element` and `element2` have the same key and bias. Since the original test case removes `element2` from the set, we need to ensure that the `element2` has the same key and bias as `element` to satisfy the condition of the test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source and follow-up inputs is that the `element` and `element2` have the same key and bias. Since the original test case removes `element2` from the set, we need to ensure that the `element2` has the same key and bias as `element` to satisfy the condition of the test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias - 1);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, bias - 1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source and follow-up inputs is that the `element` and `element2` have the same key and bias. Since the original test case removes `element2` from the set, we need to ensure that the `element2` has the same key and bias as `element` to satisfy the condition of the test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source and follow-up inputs is that the `element` and `element2` have the same key and bias. Since the original test case removes `element2` from the set, we need to ensure that the `element2` has the same key and bias as `element` to satisfy the condition of the test case.
