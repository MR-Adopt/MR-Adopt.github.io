## New input pair0:
```java
    String randomString = "12345678901234567890";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48 };
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String randomString = "12345678901234567890";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = utf8To8Byte(randomString);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is converted to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, and the resulting bytes are compared with the follow-up input. Since the source input is a valid long value, the resulting bytes will match the follow-up input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String randomString = "9223372036854775807";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48 };
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String randomString = "9223372036854775807";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = utf8To8Byte(randomString);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is converted to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, and the resulting bytes are compared with the follow-up input. Since the source input is a valid long value, the resulting bytes will match the follow-up input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String randomString = "-9223372036854775808";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48 };
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String randomString = "-9223372036854775808";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = utf8To8Byte(randomString);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is converted to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, and the resulting bytes are compared with the follow-up input. Since the source input is a valid long value, the resulting bytes will match the follow-up input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String randomString = "0";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 48 };
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String randomString = "0";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = utf8To8Byte(randomString);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is converted to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, and the resulting bytes are compared with the follow-up input. Since the source input is a valid long value, the resulting bytes will match the follow-up input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String randomString = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122 };
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String randomString = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = utf8To8Byte(randomString);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is converted to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, and the resulting bytes are compared with the follow-up input. Since the source input is a valid long value, the resulting bytes will match the follow-up input.
