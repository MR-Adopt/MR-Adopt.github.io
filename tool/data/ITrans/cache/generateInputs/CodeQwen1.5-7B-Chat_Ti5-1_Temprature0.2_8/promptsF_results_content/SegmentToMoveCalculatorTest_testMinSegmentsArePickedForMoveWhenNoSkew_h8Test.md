## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the number of segments to move in the tier when there are no segments to move. This is because the minimum number of segments to move is the lower bound of the number of segments to move, and the number of segments to move is the sum of the minimum number of segments to move and the number of segments to move to fix deviation. Since there are no segments to move, the number of segments to move is equal to the minimum number of segments to move.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the number of segments to move in the tier when there is only one segment to move. This is because the minimum number of segments to move is the lower bound of the number of segments to move, and the number of segments to move is the sum of the minimum number of segments to move and the number of segments to move to fix deviation. Since there is only one segment to move, the number of segments to move is equal to the minimum number of segments to move.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);

## New input pair3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Code to generate follow-up input:
```java

## New input pair4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
