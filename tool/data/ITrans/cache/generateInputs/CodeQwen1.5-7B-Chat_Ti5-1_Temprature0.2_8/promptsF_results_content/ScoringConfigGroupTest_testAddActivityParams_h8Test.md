## New input pair0:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("work");
    String type = "work";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `ActivityParams` object `ap` and the `String` variable `type` represent the same activity type. In this case, the activity type is "work".

## New input pair1:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("leisure");
    String type = "leisure";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `ActivityParams` object `ap` and the `String` variable `type` represent the same activity type. In this case, the activity type is "leisure".

## New input pair2:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("education");
    String type = "education";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `ActivityParams` object `ap` and the `String` variable `type` represent the same activity type. In this case, the activity type is "education".

## New input pair3:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("transit");
    String type = "transit";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `ActivityParams` object `ap` and the `String` variable `type` represent the same activity type. In this case, the activity type is "transit".

## New input pair4:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("shopping");
    String type = "shopping";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `ActivityParams` object `ap` and the `String` variable `type` represent the same activity type. In this case, the activity type is "shopping".
