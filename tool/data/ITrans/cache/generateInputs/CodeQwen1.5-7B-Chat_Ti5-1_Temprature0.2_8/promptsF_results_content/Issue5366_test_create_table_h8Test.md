## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements are normalized by removing unnecessary whitespace and special characters. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the original SQL statement while removing the extra whitespace and special characters.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 2);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 2);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements are normalized by removing unnecessary whitespace and special characters. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the original SQL statement while removing the extra whitespace and special characters.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 3, REMAINDER 1);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 3, REMAINDER 1);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements are normalized by removing unnecessary whitespace and special characters. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the original SQL statement while removing the extra whitespace and special characters.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 0);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 0);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements are normalized by removing unnecessary whitespace and special characters. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the original SQL statement while removing the extra whitespace and special characters.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 3);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements are normalized by removing unnecessary whitespace and special characters. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the original SQL statement while removing the extra whitespace and special characters.
