## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("103", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional key-value pair ("103", 3F) in the map. This ensures that the map has more than one entry, which is a valid scenario for the method under test.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes an empty key in the map. Although the method under test does not explicitly specify that the keys must be non-empty, it is a common practice in many programming languages to allow for empty keys. This ensures that the map has a non-empty key, which is a valid scenario for the method under test.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("101", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes duplicate keys in the map. Although the method under test does not explicitly specify that the keys must be unique, it is a common practice in many programming languages to allow for duplicate keys. This ensures that the map has duplicate keys, which is a valid scenario for the method under test.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put(null, 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes a null key in the map. Although the method under test does not explicitly specify that the keys must be non-null, it is a common practice in many programming languages to allow for null keys. This ensures that the map has a null key, which is a valid scenario for the method under test.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("101", null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a null value for a key in the map. Although the method under test does not explicitly specify that the values must be non-null, it is a common practice in many programming languages to allow for null values. This ensures that the map has a null value, which is a valid scenario for the method under test.
