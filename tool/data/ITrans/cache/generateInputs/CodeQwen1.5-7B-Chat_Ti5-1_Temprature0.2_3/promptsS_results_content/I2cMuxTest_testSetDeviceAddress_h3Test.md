## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of valid I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". This input tests the boundary case where the device address is at the upper limit of the valid range.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of valid I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". This input tests the boundary case where the device address is at the lower limit of the valid range.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7F";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of valid I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". This input tests the boundary case where the device address is at the upper limit of the valid range.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of valid I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". This input tests the boundary case where the device address is at the lower limit of the valid range.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0xFF";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of valid I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". This input tests the boundary case where the device address is at the upper limit of the valid range.
