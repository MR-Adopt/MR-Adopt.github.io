## New input1:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption method handles null values by throwing an exception. However, it is a boundary case as it is the smallest possible long value.

## New input2:
```java
    Long value = 99999L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption method handles null values by throwing an exception. However, it is a boundary case as it is the largest possible long value.

## New input3:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption method handles null values by throwing an exception. However, it is a boundary case as it is the smallest possible negative long value.

## New input4:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption method handles null values by throwing an exception. However, it is a boundary case as it is the maximum possible long value.

## New input5:
```java
    Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption method handles null values by throwing an exception. However, it is a boundary case as it is the minimum possible long value.
