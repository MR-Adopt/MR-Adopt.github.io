## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from 123L to 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair, and the value associated with the key "123" is different from the original value.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least two key-value pairs.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
    v01.put("789", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "789" and the value is 789L. This ensures that the map contains at least three key-value pairs.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
    v01.put("789", 789L);
    v01.put("101112", 101112L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "101112" and the value is 101112L. This ensures that the map contains at least four key-value pairs.
