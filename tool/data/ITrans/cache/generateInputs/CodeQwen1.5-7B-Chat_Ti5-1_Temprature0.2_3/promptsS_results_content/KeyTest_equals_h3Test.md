## New input1:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Integer.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Integer.class` is a valid class in Java, and it is a subclass of `Object`. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original input, ensuring that the method handles different types correctly.

## New input2:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Double.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Double.class` is a valid class in Java, and it is a subclass of `Object`. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original input, ensuring that the method handles different types correctly.

## New input3:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Boolean.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Boolean.class` is a valid class in Java, and it is a subclass of `Object`. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original input, ensuring that the method handles different types correctly.

## New input4:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Void.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Void.class` is a valid class in Java, and it is a subclass of `Object`. This input tests the method under test with a different type than the original input, ensuring that the method handles different types correctly.

## New input5:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Object.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Object.class` is a valid class in Java, and it is the superclass of all classes. This input tests the method under test with the most general type, ensuring that the method handles the most general case correctly.
