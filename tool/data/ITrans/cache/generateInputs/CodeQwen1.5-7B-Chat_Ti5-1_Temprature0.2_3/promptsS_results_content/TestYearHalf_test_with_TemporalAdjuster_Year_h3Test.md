## New input1:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2024;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year 2020 is a leap year, and the half-of-year 1 refers to the first half of the year. The year 2024 is also a leap year, making it a valid input for the method under test.

## New input2:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1904;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year 1900 is not a leap year, but the half-of-year 2 refers to the second half of the year. The year 1904 is a leap year, making it a valid input for the method under test.

## New input3:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2004;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year 2000 is a leap year, and the half-of-year 1 refers to the first half of the year. The year 2004 is also a leap year, making it a valid input for the method under test.

## New input4:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2104;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year 2100 is not a leap year, but the half-of-year 2 refers to the second half of the year. The year 2104 is a leap year, making it a valid input for the method under test.

## New input5:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1804;
```
