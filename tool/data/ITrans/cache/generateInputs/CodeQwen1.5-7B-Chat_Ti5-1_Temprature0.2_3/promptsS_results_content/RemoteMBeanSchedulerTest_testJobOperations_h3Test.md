## New input1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, but it does not store it durably. This means that the job will not be persisted across scheduler restarts.

## New input2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably(false).build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, but it does not store it durably. This means that the job will not be persisted across scheduler restarts.

## New input3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably(true).build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, and it stores it durably. This means that the job will be persisted across scheduler restarts.

## New input4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably(false).build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, but it does not store it durably. This means that the job will not be persisted across scheduler restarts.

## New input5:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably(true).build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, and it stores it durably. This means that the job will be persisted across scheduler restarts.
