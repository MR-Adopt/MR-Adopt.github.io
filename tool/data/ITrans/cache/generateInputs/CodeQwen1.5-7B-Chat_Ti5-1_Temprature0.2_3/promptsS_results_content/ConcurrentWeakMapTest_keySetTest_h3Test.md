## New input1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(2, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a new key-value pair (2, 1) that is not present in the original map. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set containing all the keys in the map, including the new one.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a new key-value pair (1, 2) that is not present in the original map. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set containing all the keys in the map, including the new one.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a new key-value pair (0, 0) that is not present in the original map. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set containing all the keys in the map, including the new one.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(6, 6);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a new key-value pair (6, 6) that is not present in the original map. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set containing all the keys in the map, including the new one.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(null, 5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a new key-value pair (null, 5) that is not present in the original map. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set containing all the keys in the map, including the new one. Note that the key in this case is null, which is a valid key in Java.
