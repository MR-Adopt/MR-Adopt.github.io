## New input1:
```java
    String fqcn = "com.example.MyClass";
    boolean currentContext = true;
    ClassLoader systemLoader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a valid fully qualified class name (fqcn) that exists within the system class loader. This ensures that the method under test will attempt to retrieve a logger context for a specific class, which is a common use case for logging frameworks.

## New input2:
```java
    String fqcn = "";
    boolean currentContext = false;
    ClassLoader systemLoader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides an empty string for the fully qualified class name (fqcn) and sets `currentContext` to `false`. This indicates that the method under test should not use the current context for logging, which could be useful in certain scenarios where the current context is not relevant or should be overridden.

## New input3:
```java
    String fqcn = "com.example.NonExistentClass";
    boolean currentContext = true;
    ClassLoader systemLoader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a non-existent fully qualified class name (fqcn) that exists within the system class loader. This ensures that the method under test will attempt to retrieve a logger context for a non-existent class, which could be useful in certain scenarios where the class does not exist but the method under test should still attempt to retrieve a logger context.

## New input4:
```java
    String fqcn = "com.example.MyClass";
    boolean currentContext = true;
    ClassLoader systemLoader = null;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a valid fully qualified class name (fqcn) and sets the system class loader to `null`. This indicates that the method under test should attempt to retrieve a logger context for a specific class using a null class loader, which could be useful in certain scenarios where the class loader is not relevant or should be overridden.

## New input5:
```java
    String fqcn = "";
    boolean currentContext = true;
    ClassLoader systemLoader = null;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides an empty string for the fully qualified class name (fqcn) and sets the system class loader to `null`. This indicates that the method under test should attempt to retrieve a logger context for a non-existent class using a null class loader, which could be useful in certain scenarios where the class does not exist but the method under test should still attempt to retrieve a logger context.
