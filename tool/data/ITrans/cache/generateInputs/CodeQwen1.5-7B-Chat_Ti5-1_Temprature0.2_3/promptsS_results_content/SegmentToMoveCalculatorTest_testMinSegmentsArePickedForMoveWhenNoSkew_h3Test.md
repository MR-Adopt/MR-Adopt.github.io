## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is less than the minimum value required for the tier to be balanced. This ensures that the method under test will not move any segments, and the test case will pass.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 50_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is greater than the maximum value allowed for the tier to be balanced. This ensures that the method under test will move all segments, and the test case will pass.

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 30_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of values allowed for the tier to be balanced. This ensures that the method under test will move some segments, and the test case will pass.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 15_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is less than the minimum value required for the tier to be balanced. This ensures that the method under test will not move any segments, and the test case will pass.

## New input5:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 40_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of values allowed for the tier to be balanced. This ensures that the method under test will move some segments, and the test case will pass.
