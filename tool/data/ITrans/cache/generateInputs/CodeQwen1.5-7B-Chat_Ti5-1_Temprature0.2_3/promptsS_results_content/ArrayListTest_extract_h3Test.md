## New input1:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because `trimFlag` is set to `true`, which means the method should trim the array before returning it. However, since `_data.length` is equal to `_size`, the method will return the original array without trimming.

## New input2:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(2);
    boolean trimFlag = false;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because `trimFlag` is set to `false`, which means the method should not trim the array before returning it. Therefore, the returned array will have three elements, which is equal to the size of the array.

## New input3:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(2);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because `trimFlag` is set to `true`, which means the method should trim the array before returning it. However, since the size of the array is three, the method will return a copy of the array with the first three elements.

## New input4:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    boolean trimFlag = false;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because `trimFlag` is set to `false`, which means the method should not trim the array before returning it. Therefore, the returned array will have one element, which is equal to the size of the array.

## New input5:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because `trimFlag` is set to `true`, which means the method should trim the array before returning it. However, since the size of the array is one, the method will return a copy of the array with the first element.
