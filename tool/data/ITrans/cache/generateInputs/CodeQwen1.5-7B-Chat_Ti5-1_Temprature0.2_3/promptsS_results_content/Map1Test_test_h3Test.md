## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key "456" and the value "def" are not the same as the original key-value pair "123" and "abc", and they do not conflict with each other.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from "abc" to "def". This change does not conflict with the original key-value pair and does not violate the requirements of the test case.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", "ghi");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key "789" and the value "ghi" are not the same as the original key-value pair "123" and "abc", and they do not conflict with each other.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "jkl");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from "abc" to "jkl". This change does not conflict with the original key-value pair and does not violate the requirements of the test case.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "mno");
    v01.put("456", "pqr");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key "456" and the value "pqr" are not the same as the original key-value pair "123" and "abc", and they do not conflict with each other.
