## New input1:
```java
    int year = Year.MAX_VALUE;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year is within the valid range of the `Year` class, and the half-of-year is 2, which is a valid value. This input tests the boundary condition where the year is at the maximum value and the half-of-year is at the maximum valid value.

## New input2:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year is within the valid range of the `Year` class, and the half-of-year is 1, which is a valid value. This input tests the boundary condition where the year is at the minimum value and the half-of-year is at the minimum valid value.

## New input3:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year is within the valid range of the `Year` class, and the half-of-year is 1, which is a valid value. This input tests the boundary condition where the year is at zero and the half-of-year is at the minimum valid value.

## New input4:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year is within the valid range of the `Year` class, and the half-of-year is 2, which is a valid value. This input tests the boundary condition where the year is at zero and the half-of-year is at the maximum valid value.

## New input5:
```java
    int year = 100;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the year is within the valid range of the `Year` class, and the half-of-year is 2, which is a valid value. This input tests the boundary condition where the year is at a valid value and the half-of-year is at the maximum valid value.
