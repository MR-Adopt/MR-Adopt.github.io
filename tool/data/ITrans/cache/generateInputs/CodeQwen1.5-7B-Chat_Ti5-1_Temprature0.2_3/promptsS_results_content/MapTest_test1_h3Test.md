## New input1:
```java
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("12x", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it maintains the same structure as the original input. It adds a new key-value pair where the key is "12x" and the value is 123, which is the same as the original input. This ensures that the test case covers a diverse set of input values.

## New input2:
```java
    v01.put("empty", "");
    v01.put("null", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair where the key is "empty" and the value is an empty string, and another key-value pair where the key is "null" and the value is null. This ensures that the test case covers a diverse set of input values, including edge cases.

## New input3:
```java
    v01.put("large", 1234567890);
    v01.put("small", -123456789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair where the key is "large" and the value is a large integer, and another key-value pair where the key is "small" and the value is a small integer. This ensures that the test case covers a diverse set of input values, including positive and negative integers.

## New input4:
```java
    v01.put("double", 123.456);
    v01.put("float", -123.456f);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair where the key is "double" and the value is a double, and another key-value pair where the key is "float" and the value is a float. This ensures that the test case covers a diverse set of input values, including floating-point numbers.

## New input5:
```java
    v01.put("boolean", true);
    v01.put("array", new int[]{1, 2, 3});
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair where the key is "boolean" and the value is a boolean, and another key-value pair where the key is "array" and the value is an array of integers. This ensures that the test case covers a diverse set of input values, including boolean and array values.
