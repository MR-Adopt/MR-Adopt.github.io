## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to 0, which means there will be no virtual threads and the pool will not be used. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge case where the number of threads is zero.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to 1, which means there will be only one virtual thread and the pool will be used. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge case where the number of threads is one.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to the maximum value of an integer, which means there will be a large number of virtual threads and the pool will be used. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge case where the number of threads is the maximum possible value.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the number of threads is set to a negative value, which is not a valid input. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge case where the number of threads is negative.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to 5, which means there will be five virtual threads and the pool will be used. This is a typical case because it tests the typical usage of the pool.
