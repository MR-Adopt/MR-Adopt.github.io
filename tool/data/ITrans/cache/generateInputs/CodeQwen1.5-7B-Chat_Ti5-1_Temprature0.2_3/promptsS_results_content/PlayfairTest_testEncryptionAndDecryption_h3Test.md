## New input1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVA";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a simple string of four characters, which is a common scenario in encryption. The string "JAVA" is also a valid input for the Playfair cipher, as it contains no repeated characters.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVAJAVA";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a string of eight characters, which is a common scenario in encryption. The string "JAVAJAVA" is also a valid input for the Playfair cipher, as it contains no repeated characters.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVAJAVAJAVA";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a string of twelve characters, which is a common scenario in encryption. The string "JAVAJAVAJAVA" is also a valid input for the Playfair cipher, as it contains no repeated characters.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVAJAVAJAVAJAVA";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a string of sixteen characters, which is a common scenario in encryption. The string "JAVAJAVAJAVAJAVA" is also a valid input for the Playfair cipher, as it contains no repeated characters.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "J";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a single character, which is a common scenario in encryption. The character "J" is also a valid input for the Playfair cipher, as it is not repeated in the string "KEYWORD".
