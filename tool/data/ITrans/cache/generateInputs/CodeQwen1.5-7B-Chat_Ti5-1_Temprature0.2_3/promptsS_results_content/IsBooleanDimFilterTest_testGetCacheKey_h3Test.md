## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value of the field "x" from "hello" to "world". This change should result in a different cache key than the original input.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the field name from "x" to "y". This change should result in a different cache key than the original input.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the column type from STRING to INTEGER. This change should result in a different cache key than the original input.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a filter context with value "world". This change should result in a different cache key than the original input.

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, null, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the value and filter context to null. This change should result in a different cache key than the original input.
