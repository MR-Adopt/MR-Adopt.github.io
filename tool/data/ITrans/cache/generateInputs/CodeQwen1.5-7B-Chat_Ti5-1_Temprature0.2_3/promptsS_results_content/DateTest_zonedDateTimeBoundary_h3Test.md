## New input1:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `ZonedDateTime` object with the same value as the original test case, and then creates an array of three `ZonedDateTime` objects with the same value. This is a boundary-case because it tests the serialization and deserialization of an array of objects with the same value.

## New input2:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[0];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an empty array of `ZonedDateTime` objects, and then fills it with the same value as the original test case. This is a boundary-case because it tests the serialization and deserialization of an empty array of objects.

## New input3:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[1];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an array of one `ZonedDateTime` object, and then fills it with the same value as the original test case. This is a boundary-case because it tests the serialization and deserialization of an array of objects with one element.

## New input4:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[100];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an array of 100 `ZonedDateTime` objects, and then fills it with the same value as the original test case. This is a boundary-case because it tests the serialization and deserialization of an array of objects with a large number of elements.

## New input5:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[Integer.MAX_VALUE];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an array of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` `ZonedDateTime` objects, and then fills it with the same value as the original test case. This is a boundary-case because it tests the serialization and deserialization of an array of objects with a very large number of elements.
