## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(1, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the method with a single dimension, which is a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the smallest power of 2 is 1.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(16, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(16);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the method with a maximum dimension, which is a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the largest power of 2 is 16.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(17, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(17);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the method with a dimension that is not a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the smallest non-power of 2 is 17.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(32, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(32);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the method with a dimension that is a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the largest power of 2 is 32.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(33, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(33);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the method with a dimension that is not a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the smallest non-power of 2 is 33.
