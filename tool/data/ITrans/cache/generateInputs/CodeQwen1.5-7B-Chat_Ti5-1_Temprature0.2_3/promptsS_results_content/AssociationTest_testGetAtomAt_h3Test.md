## New input1:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an Association with two atoms, C and O, and sets the position to 0. This is a common scenario where an atom is added to an association.

## New input2:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an Association with two atoms, C and O, and sets the position to 1. This is a common scenario where an atom is added to an association.

## New input3:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an Association with two atoms, C and O, and sets the position to 2. This is a common scenario where an atom is added to an association.

## New input4:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = -1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an Association with two atoms, C and O, and sets the position to -1. This is a common scenario where an atom is added to an association.

## New input5:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 3;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an Association with two atoms, C and O, and sets the position to 3. This is a common scenario where an atom is added to an association.
