```java
    StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
    String queryTitle = "p";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it selects all paragraph elements, which are present in the parsed HTML. The boundary case is when there are no paragraph elements in the HTML, in which case the method should return null.

## New input2:

    StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
    String queryTitle = "title";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it selects the title element, which is present in the parsed HTML. The boundary case is when there is no title element in the HTML, in which case the method should return null.

## New input3:

    StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
    String queryTitle = "h1";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it selects the h1 element, which is not present in the parsed HTML. The boundary case is when there is no h1 element in the HTML, in which case the method should return null.

## New input4:
```java
    StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
    String queryTitle = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it selects no elements, which is a valid query. The boundary case is when the query is an empty string, in which case the method should return null.

## New input5:
```java
    StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
