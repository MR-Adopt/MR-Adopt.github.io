## New input1:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "192.168.1.1". This change could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test, as the IP address is used in the hashCode calculation.

## New input2:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "10.0.0.1". This change could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test, as the IP address is used in the hashCode calculation.

## New input3:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "172.16.0.1". This change could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test, as the IP address is used in the hashCode calculation.

## New input4:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "8.8.8.8". This change could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test, as the IP address is used in the hashCode calculation.

## New input5:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "0.0.0.0". This change could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test, as the IP address is used in the hashCode calculation.
