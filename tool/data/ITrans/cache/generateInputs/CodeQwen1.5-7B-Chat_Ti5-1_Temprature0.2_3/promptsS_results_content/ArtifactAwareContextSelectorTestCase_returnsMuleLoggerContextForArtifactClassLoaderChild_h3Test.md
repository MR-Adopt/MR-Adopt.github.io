## New input1:
```java
    RegionClassLoader regionClassLoader = this.regionClassLoader;
    String fqcn = "com.example.MyClass";
    boolean currentContext = true;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a non-empty string as the fully qualified class name (fqcn). This is a typical use case where the method under test is called with a valid input.

## New input2:
```java
    RegionClassLoader regionClassLoader = null;
    String fqcn = "";
    boolean currentContext = true;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a null value for the regionClassLoader. This is a boundary case as the method under test should handle null inputs gracefully.

## New input3:
```java
    RegionClassLoader regionClassLoader = this.regionClassLoader;
    String fqcn = "";
    boolean currentContext = false;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a non-empty string as the fully qualified class name (fqcn) and a false value for the currentContext flag. This is a typical use case where the method under test is called with a valid input.

## New input4:
```java
    RegionClassLoader regionClassLoader = this.regionClassLoader;
    String fqcn = "com.example.MyClass";
    boolean currentContext = false;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a non-empty string as the fully qualified class name (fqcn) and a false value for the currentContext flag. This is a typical use case where the method under test is called with a valid input.

## New input5:
```java
    RegionClassLoader regionClassLoader = null;
    String fqcn = "com.example.MyClass";
    boolean currentContext = true;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a null value for the regionClassLoader and a non-empty string as the fully qualified class name (fqcn). This is a boundary case as the method under test should handle null inputs gracefully.
