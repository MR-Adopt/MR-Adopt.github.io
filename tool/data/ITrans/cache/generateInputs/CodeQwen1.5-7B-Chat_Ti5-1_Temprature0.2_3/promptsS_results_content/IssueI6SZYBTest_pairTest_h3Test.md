## New input1:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents a pair of zeros, which is a valid and meaningful pair of integers.

## New input2:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(-1, -1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents a pair of negative ones, which is a valid and meaningful pair of integers.

## New input3:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents a pair of the maximum possible integer values, which is a valid and meaningful pair of integers.

## New input4:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents a pair of the minimum possible integer values, which is a valid and meaningful pair of integers.

## New input5:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(null, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents a pair of null values, which is a valid and meaningful pair of integers.
