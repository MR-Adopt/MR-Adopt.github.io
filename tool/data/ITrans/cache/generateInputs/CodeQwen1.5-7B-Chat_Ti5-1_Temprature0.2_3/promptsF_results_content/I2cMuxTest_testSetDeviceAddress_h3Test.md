## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
In this new input pair, we start by creating a new instance of `I2cMux` called `i2cMux2`. We then set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0x78" using the `setDeviceAddress` method. After that, we compare the device address of `i2cMux2` with the expected address "0x78" using the `assertEquals` method. This ensures that the device address of `i2cMux2` is correctly set to "0x78" and that the assertion passes.

## New input pair1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
In this new input pair, we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0x6F" and then compare it with the expected address "0x6F" using the `assertEquals` method. This ensures that the device address of `i2cMux2` is correctly set to "0x6F" and that the assertion passes.

## New input pair2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7F";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
In this new input pair, we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0x7F" and then compare it with the expected address "0x7F" using the `assertEquals` method. This ensures that the device address of `i2cMux2` is correctly set to "0x7F" and that the assertion passes.

## New input pair3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
In this new input pair, we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0x00" and then compare it with the expected address "0x00" using the `assertEquals` method. This ensures that the device address of `i2cMux2` is correctly set to "0x00" and that the assertion passes.

## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0xFF";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
In this new input pair, we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0xFF" and then compare it with the expected address "0xFF" using the `assertEquals` method. This ensures that the device address of `i2cMux2` is correctly set to "0xFF" and that the assertion passes.
