## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1);
int year = 2020;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 1, so the expected year-half is 1.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2021, 12, 31);
int year = 2021;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 12, so the expected year-half is 2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(1900, 6, 15);
int year = 1900;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 6, so the expected year-half is 1.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2100, 2, 28);
int year = 2100;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 2, so the expected year-half is 1.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(1800, 11, 30);
int year = 1800;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 11, so the expected year-half is 2.
