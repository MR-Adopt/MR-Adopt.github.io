## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "0.9";
    String v2 = "0.91";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version that is higher than `v1`. Since `0.9` is a valid version, and `0.91` is higher than `0.9`, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version that is higher than `v1`. Since `1.0.0` is a valid version, and `1.0.1` is higher than `1.0.0`, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.9";
    String v2 = "2.0";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version that is higher than `v1`. Since `1.9` is a valid version, and `2.0` is higher than `1.9`, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version that is higher than `v1`. Since `1.0-A1` is a valid version, and `1.0-A2` is higher than `1.0-A1`, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version that is higher than `v1`. Since `1.0.0-A1` is a valid version, and `1.0.0-A2` is higher than `1.0.0-A1`, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
