## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation by using the year 2020 and half 2, which results in the text "2020-h2".

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h1";
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation by using the year 1900 and half 1, which results in the text "1900-h1".

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation by using the year 2000 and half 2, which results in the text "2000-h2".

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "9999-h1";
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation by using the year 9999 and half 1, which results in the text "9999-h1".

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 10000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "10000-h2";
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation by using the year 10000 and half 2, which results in the text "10000-h2".
