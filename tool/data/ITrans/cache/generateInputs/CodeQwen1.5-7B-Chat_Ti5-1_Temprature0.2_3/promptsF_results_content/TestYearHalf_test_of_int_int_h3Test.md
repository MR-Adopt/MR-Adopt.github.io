## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = Year.MAX_VALUE;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` is created by calling the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values from the original test case. Since `Year.MAX_VALUE` is the maximum valid year, and `2` is a valid half-of-year, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` is created by calling the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values from the original test case. Since `Year.MIN_VALUE` is the minimum valid year, and `1` is a valid half-of-year, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` is created by calling the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values from the original test case. Since `0` is a valid year, and `1` is a valid half-of-year, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` is created by calling the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values from the original test case. Since `0` is a valid year, and `2` is a valid half-of-year, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 100;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` is created by calling the `of` method with the `year` and `half` values from the original test case. Since `100` is a valid year, and `2` is a valid half-of-year, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
