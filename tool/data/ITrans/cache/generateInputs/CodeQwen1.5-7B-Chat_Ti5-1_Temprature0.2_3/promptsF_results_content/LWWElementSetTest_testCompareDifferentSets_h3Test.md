## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
### Generating follow-up input:
To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we need to ensure that the 'element2' has a different key than 'element1'. We can achieve this by assigning a different key to 'element2'.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key3", 2, bias);
```
### Generating follow-up input:
To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we need to ensure that the 'element2' has a different key than 'element1'. We can achieve this by assigning a different key to 'element2'.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 3, bias);
```
### Generating follow-up input:
To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we need to ensure that the 'element2' has a different key than 'element1'. We can achieve this by assigning a different key to 'element2'.
