## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.0";
```
The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should be equal if they are valid versions. Since `v1` is "1.0.0" and `v2` is also "1.0.0", they should be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should be equal if they are valid versions. Since `v1` is "1.0-A1" and `v2` is also "1.0-A1", they should be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should be equal if they are valid versions. Since `v1` is "1.1.0-A1" and `v2` is also "1.1.0-A1", they should be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1+B2";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1+B2";
```
The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should be equal if they are valid versions. Since `v1` is "1.1.0-A1+B2" and `v2` is also "1.1.0-A1+B2", they should be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0+B2";
    String v2 = "1.0.0+B2";
```
The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should be equal if they are valid versions. Since `v1` is "1.0.0+B2" and `v2` is also "1.0.0+B2", they should be equal.
