## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.1.1";
    long ipLong2 = 3232235777L;
```
The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained by manually converting the IPv4 address to a long value.
To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the IPv4 address "192.168.1.1" to a long value. The resulting long value is 3232235777L.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 167772161L;
```
The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained by manually converting the IPv4 address to a long value.
To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the IPv4 address "10.0.0.1" to a long value. The resulting long value is 167772161L.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 2886723073L;
```
The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained by manually converting the IPv4 address to a long value.
To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the IPv4 address "172.16.0.1" to a long value. The resulting long value is 2886723073L.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "8.8.8.8";
    long ipLong2 = 134744072L;
```
The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained by manually converting the IPv4 address to a long value.
To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the IPv4 address "8.8.8.8" to a long value. The resulting long value is 134744072L.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "0.0.0.0";
    long ipLong2 = 0L;
```
The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained by manually converting the IPv4 address to a long value.
To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert the IPv4 address "0.0.0.0" to a long value. The resulting long value is 0L.
