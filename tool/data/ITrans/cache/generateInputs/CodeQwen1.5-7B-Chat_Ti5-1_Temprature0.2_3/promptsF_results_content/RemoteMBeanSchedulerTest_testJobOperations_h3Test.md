## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `job2Detail` and `job22` are related to each other. The `job2Detail` is created using the `newJob` method with the `HelloJob.class`, `JobKey` with name "job2" and group "GROUP_KEY", and `storeDurably` method with default value. The `job22` is created using the `JobKey` with name "job2" and group "GROUP_KEY". The `storeDurably` method is not used in the `job2Detail` creation, so the `job22` is also durably stored.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably(false).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
