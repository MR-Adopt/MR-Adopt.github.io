## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the SQL statements are identical, except for the addition of parentheses around the column names in the source input. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the same column names and data types as the original input, but with parentheses added around them.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the SQL statements are identical, except for the addition of parentheses around the column names in the source input. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the same column names and data types as the original input, but with parentheses added around them.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS ORC";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS ORC";
```
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the SQL statements are identical, except for the addition of parentheses around the column names in the source input. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the same column names and data types as the original input, but with parentheses added around them.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS PARQUET";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS PARQUET";
```
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the SQL statements are identical, except for the addition of parentheses around the column names in the source input. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the same column names and data types as the original input, but with parentheses added around them.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS AVRO";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS AVRO";
```
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the SQL statements are identical, except for the addition of parentheses around the column names in the source input. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it maintains the same column names and data types as the original input, but with parentheses added around them.
