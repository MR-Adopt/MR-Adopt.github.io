## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the only difference between them is the addition of a space after the comma in the `MODULUS` and `REMAINDER` values. The `normalizeSql` method is used to remove all unnecessary spaces and special characters from the SQL string, so the follow-up input is generated by adding a space after the comma in the `MODULUS` and `REMAINDER` values. This ensures that the normalized SQL strings are equal and pass the assertion in the original test case.
