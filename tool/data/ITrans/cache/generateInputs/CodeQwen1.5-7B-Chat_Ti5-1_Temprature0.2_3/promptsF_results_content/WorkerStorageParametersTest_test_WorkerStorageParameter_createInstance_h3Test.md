## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` and `l2` should be equal, and the follow-up input `b` should be `false`. This is because the method under test `createInstance` does not use the value of `l` or `l2` in its calculation, and it only uses the value of `b` to determine whether to create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a negative value. Since `l` and `l2` are both 0, and `b` is false, the method under test will create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a value of -1.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` and `l2` should be equal, and the follow-up input `b` should be `false`. This is because the method under test `createInstance` does not use the value of `l` or `l2` in its calculation, and it only uses the value of `b` to determine whether to create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a negative value. Since `l` and `l2` are both -1, and `b` is false, the method under test will create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a value of -1.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` and `l2` should be equal, and the follow-up input `b` should be `false`. This is because the method under test `createInstance` does not use the value of `l` or `l2` in its calculation, and it only uses the value of `b` to determine whether to create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a negative value. Since `l` and `l2` are both `Long.MAX_VALUE`, and `b` is false, the method under test will create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a value of -1.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
    long l2 = 500000000;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
    long l2 = 500000000;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` and `l2` should be equal, and the follow-up input `b` should be `false`. This is because the method under test `createInstance` does not use the value of `l` or `l2` in its calculation, and it only uses the value of `b` to determine whether to create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a negative value. Since `l` and `l2` are both 500,000,000, and `b` is false, the method under test will create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a value of -1.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = 10000000000L;
    long l2 = 10000000000L;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 10000000000L;
    long l2 = 10000000000L;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` and `l2` should be equal, and the follow-up input `b` should be `false`. This is because the method under test `createInstance` does not use the value of `l` or `l2` in its calculation, and it only uses the value of `b` to determine whether to create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a negative value. Since `l` and `l2` are both 10,000,000,000, and `b` is false, the method under test will create a `WorkerStorageParameters` object with a value of -1.
