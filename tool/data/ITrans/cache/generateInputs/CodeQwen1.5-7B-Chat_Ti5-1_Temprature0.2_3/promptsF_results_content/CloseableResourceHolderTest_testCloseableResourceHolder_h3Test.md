# New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be the result of calling `ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable)` with the same `closeable` object. Since `closeable` is a lambda expression that does not throw any exceptions, the `holder2` should also not throw any exceptions when its `get()` method is called.

# New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be the result of calling `ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable)` with the same `closeable` object. Since `closeable` is an anonymous class that throws an `IOException` when its `close()` method is called, the `holder2` should also throw an `IOException` when its `get()` method is called.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be the result of calling `ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable)` with the same `closeable` object.
