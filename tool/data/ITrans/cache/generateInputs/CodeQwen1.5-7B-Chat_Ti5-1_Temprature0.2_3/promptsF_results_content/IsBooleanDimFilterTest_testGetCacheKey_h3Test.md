## New input pair0:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `EqualityFilter` objects `f3` and `f4` should have the same cache key. This is because the `getCacheKey()` method of the `IsFalseDimFilter` class returns the cache key of the underlying `EqualityFilter` object. Since the `EqualityFilter` objects `f3` and `f4` have the same values for the `column`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` fields, their cache keys should also be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
