## New input pair0:
```java
    String tier = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

## Explanation:
The new input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same tier and historicals as the original test case. The only difference is that the total number of segments across the two servers is the same, which means that the number of segments to move to fix skew should remain the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String tier = "tier3";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier3";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

## Explanation:
The new input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same tier and historicals as the original test case. The only difference is that the total number of segments across the three servers is the same, which means that the number of segments to move to fix skew should remain the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String tier = "tier4";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier4";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

## Explanation:
The new input pair2 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same tier and historicals as the original test case. The only difference is that the total number of segments across the two servers is the same, which means that the number of segments to move to fix skew should remain the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String tier = "tier5";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier5";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

## Explanation:
The new input pair3 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same tier and historicals as the original test case. The only difference is that the total number of segments across the four servers is the same, which means that the number of segments to move to fix skew should remain the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String tier = "tier6";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", Collections.emptyList()));
    String tier2 = "tier6";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", Collections.emptyList()));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

## Explanation:
The new input pair4 satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same tier and historicals as the original test case. The only difference is that the total number of segments across the two servers is the same, which means that the number of segments to move to fix skew should remain the same.
