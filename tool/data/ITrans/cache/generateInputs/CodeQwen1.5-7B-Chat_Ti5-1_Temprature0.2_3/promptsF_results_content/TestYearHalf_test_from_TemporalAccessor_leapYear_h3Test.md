## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object. Since the year is incremented by 1, the `expected` value also increments by 1. Therefore, for a new `year` of 2009, the `expected` value would be the same as the original `expected` value.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2010;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    int year = 2010;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object. Since the year is incremented by 1, the `expected` value also increments by 1. Therefore, for a new `year` of 2010, the `expected` value would be the same as the original `expected` value.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2011;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
    int year = 2011;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object. Since the year is incremented by 1, the `expected` value also increments by 1. Therefore, for a new `year` of 2011, the `expected` value would be the same as the original `expected` value.
