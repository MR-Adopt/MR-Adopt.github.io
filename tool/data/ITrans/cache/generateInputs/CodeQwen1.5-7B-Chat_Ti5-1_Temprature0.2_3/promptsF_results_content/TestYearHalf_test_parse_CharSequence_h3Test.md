## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. In this case, the source input is (2020, 1), and the follow-up input is (2020, 1) with the corresponding text "2020-H1".

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H2";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. In this case, the source input is (2020, 2), and the follow-up input is (2020, 2) with the corresponding text "2020-H2".

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 3;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H3";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 3;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H3";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. In this case, the source input is (2020, 3), and the follow-up input is (2020, 3) with the corresponding text "2020-H3".

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 0;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H0";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 0;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H0";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. In this case, the source input is (2020, 0), and the follow-up input is (2020, 0) with the corresponding text "2020-H0".

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = -1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H-1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = -1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H-1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. In this case, the source input is (2020, -1), and the follow-up input is (2020, -1) with the corresponding text "2020-H-1".
