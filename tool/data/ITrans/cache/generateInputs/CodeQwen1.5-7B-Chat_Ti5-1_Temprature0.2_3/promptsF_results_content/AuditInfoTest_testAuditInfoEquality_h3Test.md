## New input pair0:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
Generation code:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hash codes of two AuditInfo objects are equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and ip. Since the source input `auditInfo1` has the same author, identity, comment, and ip as `auditInfo2`, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
```
Generation code:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");

Generation code:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");

## New input pair3:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
```
Generation code:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");

## New input pair4:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
