## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 1);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half values are passed to the `YearHalf.of()` method to create a new `YearHalf` object. The `lengthOfYear()` method is then called on the `test2` object to get the length of the year, which is compared to the expected value using `assertEquals()`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 2);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half values are passed to the `YearHalf.of()` method to create a new `YearHalf` object. The `lengthOfYear()` method is then called on the `test2` object to get the length of the year, which is compared to the expected value using `assertEquals()`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 1);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half values are passed to the `YearHalf.of()` method to create a new `YearHalf` object. The `lengthOfYear()` method is then called on the `test2` object to get the length of the year, which is compared to the expected value using `assertEquals()`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 2);
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 1);
```
