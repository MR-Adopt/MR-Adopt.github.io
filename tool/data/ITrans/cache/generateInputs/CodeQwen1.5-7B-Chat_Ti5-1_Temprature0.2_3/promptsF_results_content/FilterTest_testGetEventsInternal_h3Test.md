## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new filter object `filter2` and adds the same mock event `mockEvent1` to it. This ensures that the internal events list of `filter2` is a copy of the original list of `filter`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new filter object `filter2` and adds the same mock events `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2` to it. This ensures that the internal events list of `filter2` is a copy of the original list of `filter`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates two new filter objects `filter` and `filter2`. Since both filters are empty, their internal events lists are also empty, and thus are not the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent3);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent3);
```

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new filter object `filter2` and adds the same mock events `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`, and `mockEvent3` to it. This ensures that the internal events list of `filter2` is a copy of the original list of `filter`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent3);
    filter.add(mockEvent4);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent3);
    filter2.add(mockEvent4);
```

Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new filter object `filter2` and adds the same mock events `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`, `mockEvent3`, and `mockEvent4` to it. This ensures that the internal events list of `filter2` is a copy of the original list of `filter`.
