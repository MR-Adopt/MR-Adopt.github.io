## New input pair0:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000000");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 46, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 34, 44, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 46, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 42;
```
Explanation: The new input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation by using the same `LocalTime` object `now` and the same `JsonWriter` instance `jw`. The only difference is that the `LocalTime` object `now` is parsed from "00:00:00.000000000" instead of "12:13:14.123456789". The `body` byte array is also updated to reflect the new `LocalTime` object. The `size` variable is also updated to reflect the new size of the `body` array.

## New input pair1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 51, 58, 57, 57, 58, 57, 57, 46, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 34, 44, 34, 50, 51, 58, 57, 57, 58, 57, 57, 46, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 42;
```

    int size = 9;
```
Explanation: The new input pair2 satisfies the inferred relation by using the same `LocalTime` object `now` and the same `JsonWriter` instance `jw`. The only difference is that the `LocalTime` object `now` is parsed from "12:13:14.123456789" instead of "12:13:14.123456789".

## New input pair3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[1];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };

The only difference is that the `LocalTime` object `now` is parsed from "12:13:14.123456789" instead of "12:13:14.123456789". The `body` byte array is also updated to reflect the new `LocalTime` object. The `size` variable is also updated to reflect the new size of the `body` array.

## New input pair4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 86;
```
Explanation: The new input pair4 satisfies the inferred relation by using the same `LocalTime` object `now` and the same `JsonWriter` instance `jw`. The only difference is that the `LocalTime` object `now` is parsed from "12:13:14.123456789" instead of "12:13:14.123456789".
