## New input pair0:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` is created with an empty string as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type. The `other3` is created with an empty string as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type, but it is deprecated. Since the `hashCode()` method of `FieldDefinition` uses the `Objects.hash()` method, which considers `null` and empty strings as equal, the `hashCode()` of `subject` and `other3` will be the same. However, the `equals()` method considers `null` and empty strings as different, so the `subject` and `other3` will not be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition(null, TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition(null, TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` is created with `null` as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type. The `other3` is created with `null` as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type, but it is deprecated. Since the `hashCode()` method of `FieldDefinition` uses the `Objects.hash()` method, which considers `null` and empty strings as equal, the `hashCode()` of `subject` and `other3` will be the same. However, the `equals()` method considers `null` and empty strings as different, so the `subject` and `other3` will not be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.NULL);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.NULL).deprecate();
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` is created with `"foo"` as the name and `TokenType.NULL` as the type. The `other3` is created with `"foo"` as the name and `TokenType.NULL` as the type, but it is deprecated. Since the `hashCode()` method of `FieldDefinition` uses the `Objects.hash()` method, which considers `null` and empty strings as equal, the `hashCode()` of `subject` and `other3` will be the same. However, the `equals()` method considers `null` and empty strings as different, so the `subject` and `other3` will not be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` is created with `"foo"` as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type, but it is deprecated. The `other3` is created with `"foo"` as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type, but it is deprecated as well. Since the `hashCode()` method of `FieldDefinition` uses the `Objects.hash()` method, which considers `null` and empty strings as equal, the `hashCode()` of `subject` and `other3` will be the same. The `equals()` method considers deprecated and non-deprecated fields as different, so the `subject` and `other3` will be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description").deprecate();
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `subject` is created with `"foo"` as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and a description. The `other3` is created with `"foo"` as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, a description, and it is deprecated. Since the `hashCode()` method of `FieldDefinition` uses the `Objects.hash()` method, which considers `null` and empty strings as equal, the `hashCode()` of `subject` and `other3` will be the same. The `equals()` method considers deprecated and non-deprecated fields as different, so the `subject` and `other3` will be equal.
