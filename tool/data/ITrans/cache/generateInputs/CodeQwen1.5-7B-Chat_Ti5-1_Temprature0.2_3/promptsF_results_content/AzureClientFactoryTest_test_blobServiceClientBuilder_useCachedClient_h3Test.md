## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal if `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are equal and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are equal to 3, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal to "account", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal if `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are equal and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are equal to 0, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal to "account", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal if `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are equal and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both null, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal to "newAccount", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal if `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are equal and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are equal to 5, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal to "newAccount", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2` should be equal if `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are equal and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both -1, and `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are equal to "account", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
