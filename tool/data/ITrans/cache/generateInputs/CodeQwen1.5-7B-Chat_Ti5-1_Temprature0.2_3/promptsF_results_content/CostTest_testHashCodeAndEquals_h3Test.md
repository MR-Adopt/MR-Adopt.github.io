## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects is equal if and only if they have the same value. Since subject has a value of 0 and other has a value of 1, their hashCodes will be different.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(101);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects is equal if and only if they have the same value. Since subject has a value of 100 and other has a value of 101, their hashCodes will be different.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects is equal if and only if they have the same value. Since subject has a value of -1 and other has a value of -2, their hashCodes will be different.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(999999999);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000000);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects is equal if and only if they have the same value. Since subject has a value of 999999999 and other has a value of 1000000000, their hashCodes will be different.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(50);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(51);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects is equal if and only if they have the same value. Since subject has a value of 50 and other has a value of 51, their hashCodes will be different.
