# INFERRED RELATION
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year2` in the original test case should be replaced with the `year3` from the new source input.

# NEW INPUT PAIR0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int year3 = 2022;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int year3 = year2; // Replace year2 with year3 from new source input
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In the new input pair, `year2` is replaced with the `year3` from the new source input, which is `2022`. This satisfies the inferred relation that `year2` should be replaced with `year3`.

# NEW INPUT PAIR1:
```java
    int year1 = 1990;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1988;
    int year3 = 1988;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 1990;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1988;
    int year3 = year2; // Replace year2 with year3 from new source input
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In the new input pair, `year2` is replaced with the `year3` from the new source input, which is `1988`. This satisfies the inferred relation that `year2` should be replaced with `year3`.

# NEW INPUT PAIR2:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = year2; // Replace year2 with year3 from new source input
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In the new input pair, `year2` is replaced with the `year3` from the new source input, which is `2020`. This satisfies the inferred relation that `year2` should be replaced with `year3`.

# NEW INPUT PAIR3:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = year2; // Replace year2 with year3 from new source input
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In the new input pair, `year2` is replaced with the `year3` from the new source input, which is `2020`. This satisfies the inferred relation that `year2` should be replaced with `year3`.

# NEW INPUT PAIR4:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2021;
    int year3 = 2021;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2021;
    int year3 = year2; // Replace year2 with year3 from new source input
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In the new input pair, `year2` is replaced with the `year3` from the new source input, which is `2021`. This satisfies the inferred relation that `year2` should be replaced with `year3`.
