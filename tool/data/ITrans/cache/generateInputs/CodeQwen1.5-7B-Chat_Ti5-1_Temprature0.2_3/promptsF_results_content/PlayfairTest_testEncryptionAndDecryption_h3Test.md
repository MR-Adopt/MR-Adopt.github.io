# New input pair0:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVA";
    String textTodecrypt = "SHHAHRFB";
```
Explanation: The original test case tests the encryption and decryption of the Playfair cipher. The source input `plaintext` is "JAVA", which is the encrypted version of the original plaintext "PLAYFAIR" using the same key "KEYWORD". Therefore, the follow-up input `textTodecrypt` should be the encrypted version of the new plaintext "JAVA" using the same key "KEYWORD".

# New input pair1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVAJAVA";
    String textTodecrypt = "SHHAHRFB";
```
Explanation: The original test case tests the encryption and decryption of the Playfair cipher. The source input `plaintext` is "JAVAJAVA", which is the encrypted version of the original plaintext "PLAYFAIR" using the same key "KEYWORD". Therefore, the follow-up input `textTodecrypt` should be the encrypted version of the new plaintext "JAVAJAVA" using the same key "KEYWORD".

# New input pair2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVAJAVAJAVA";
    String textTodecrypt = "SHHAHRFB";
```
Explanation: The original test case tests the encryption and decryption of the Playfair cipher. The source input `plaintext` is "JAVAJAVAJAVA", which is the encrypted version of the original plaintext "PLAYFAIR" using the same key "KEYWORD". Therefore, the follow-up input `textTodecrypt` should be the encrypted version of the new plaintext "JAVAJAVAJAVA" using the same key "KEYWORD".

# New input pair3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVAJAVAJAVAJAVA";
    String textTodecrypt = "SHHAHRFB";
```
Explanation: The original test case tests the encryption and decryption of the Playfair cipher. The source input `plaintext` is "JAVAJAVAJAVAJAVA", which is the encrypted version of the original plaintext "PLAYFAIR" using the same key "KEYWORD". Therefore, the follow-up input `textTodecrypt` should be the encrypted version of the new plaintext "JAVAJAVAJAVAJAVA" using the same key "KEYWORD".

# New input pair4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "J";
    String textTodecrypt = "SHHAHRFB";
```
Explanation: The original test case tests the encryption and decryption of the Playfair cipher. The source input `plaintext` is "J", which is the encrypted version of the original plaintext "PLAYFAIR" using the same key "KEYWORD". Therefore, the follow-up input `textTodecrypt` should be the encrypted version of the new plaintext "J" using the same key "KEYWORD".
