# New input pair0:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
    String token2 = "b";
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    String token1 = "b";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both should result in a JsonNodePath object that is equal to itself. The new source input "b" satisfies this relation because it is appended to the root path twice, resulting in a path with the same tokens.

# New input pair1:
```java
    String token1 = "1";
    String token2 = "1";
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    String token1 = "1";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both should result in a JsonNodePath object that is equal to itself. The new source input "1" satisfies this relation because it is appended to the root path twice, resulting in a path with the same tokens.

# New input pair2:
```java
    String token1 = "a1";
    String token2 = "a1";
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    String token1 = "a1";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both should result in a JsonNodePath object that is equal to itself. The new source input "a1" satisfies this relation because it is appended to the root path twice, resulting in a path with the same tokens.

# New input pair3:
```java
    String token1 = "a_";
    String token2 = "a_";
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    String token1 = "a_";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both should result in a JsonNodePath object that is equal to itself. The new source input "a_" satisfies this relation because it is appended to the root path twice, resulting in a path with the same tokens.

# New input pair4:
```java
    String token1 = "a ";
    String token2 = "a ";
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    String token1 = "a ";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both should result in a JsonNodePath object that is equal to itself. The new source input "a " satisfies this relation because it is appended to the root path twice, resulting in a path with the same tokens.
