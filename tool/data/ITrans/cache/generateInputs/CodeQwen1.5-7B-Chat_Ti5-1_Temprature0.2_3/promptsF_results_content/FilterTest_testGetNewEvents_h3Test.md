## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "2022-12-31", "Category2");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: The new source input0 satisfies the inferred relation by adding two different events to the filter. The first event is an instance of `FilterEventMock` with the name "Event1", date "2022-01-01", and category "Category1". The second event is an instance of `FilterEventMock` with the name "Event2", date "2022-12-31", and category "Category2". The follow-up input adds these two events to the filter2, and then calls the `getNewEvents()` method to retrieve the new events. The assertions in the original test case will pass, as the expected output is an array containing the JSON event objects of the two events in the filter2.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "2022-06-15", "Category3");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: The new source input1 satisfies the inferred relation by adding two different events to the filter. The first event is an instance of `FilterEventMock` with the name "Event3", date "2022-06-15", and category "Category3". The second event is an instance of `FilterEventMock` with the name "Event4", date "2022-01-01", and category "Category1". The follow-up input adds these two events to the filter2, and then calls the `getNewEvents()` method to retrieve the new events. The assertions in the original test case will pass, as the expected output is an array containing the JSON event objects of the two events in the filter2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "2022-01-01", "");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event6", "2022-01-01", "Category1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: The new source input2 satisfies the inferred relation by adding two different events to the filter. The first event is an instance of `FilterEventMock` with the name "Event5", date "2022-01-01", and an empty category. The second event is an instance of `FilterEventMock` with the name "Event6", date "2022-01-01", and category "Category1". The follow-up input adds these two events to the filter2, and then calls the `getNewEvents()` method to retrieve the new events. The assertions in the original test case will pass, as the expected output is an array containing the JSON event objects of the two events in the filter2.
