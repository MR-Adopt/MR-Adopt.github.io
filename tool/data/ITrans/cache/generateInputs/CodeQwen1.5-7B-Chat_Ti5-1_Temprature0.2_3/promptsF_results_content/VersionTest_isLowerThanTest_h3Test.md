## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "0.0";
    String v2 = "0.1";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is comparing two versions, the new source input `v1` is a lower version than `v2`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0";
    String v2 = "2.1";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is comparing two versions, the new source input `v1` is a lower version than `v2`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1";
    String v2 = "1.2";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is comparing two versions, the new source input `v1` is a lower version than `v2`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-B1";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is comparing two versions, the new source input `v1` is a lower version than `v2`.
