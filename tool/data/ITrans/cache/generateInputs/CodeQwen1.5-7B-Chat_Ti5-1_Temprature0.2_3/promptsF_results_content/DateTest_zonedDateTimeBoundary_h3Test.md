This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by providing the same source input `jw` and `lts` as in the original test case, but with a different manifest and body. The manifest is `ZonedDateTime[]` and the body is the serialized form of the array `lts`. The size is also the same as in the original test case.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by providing the same source input `jw` and `lts` as in the original test case, but with a different manifest and body. The manifest is `ZonedDateTime[]` and the body is the serialized form of an empty array `lts`. The size is also the same as in the original test case.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by providing the same source input `jw` and `lts` as in the original test case, but with a different manifest and body. The manifest is `ZonedDateTime[]` and the body is the serialized form of an array with one element `lts`. The size is also the same as in the original test case.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by providing the same source input `jw` and `lts` as in the original test case, but with a different manifest and body. The manifest is `ZonedDateTime[]` and the body is the serialized form of an array with 100 elements `lts`. The size is also the same as in the original test case.
