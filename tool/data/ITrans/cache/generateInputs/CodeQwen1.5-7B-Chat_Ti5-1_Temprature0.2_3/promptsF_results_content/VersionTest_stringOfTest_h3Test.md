## New input pair0:
```java
    String v = "2.0.0";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `stringOf()` method returns the original version string when called with a `Version` object. Since the original version string is "1.0.0", the `stringOf()` method should return "1.0.0" when called with a `Version` object created from the string "2.0.0". Therefore, the follow-up input is a `Version` object created from the string "2.0.0".

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v = "1.1.0";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `stringOf()` method returns the original version string when called with a `Version` object. Since the original version string is "1.0.0", the `stringOf()` method should return "1.0.0" when called with a `Version` object created from the string "1.1.0". Therefore, the follow-up input is a `Version` object created from the string "1.1.0".

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v = "1.0.1";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `stringOf()` method returns the original version string when called with a `Version` object. Since the original version string is "1.0.0", the `stringOf()` method should return "1.0.0" when called with a `Version` object created from the string "1.0.1". Therefore, the follow-up input is a `Version` object created from the string "1.0.1".

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0-A1";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `stringOf()` method returns the original version string when called with a `Version` object. Since the original version string is "1.0.0", the `stringOf()` method should return "1.0.0" when called with a `Version` object created from the string "1.0.0-A1". Therefore, the follow-up input is a `Version` object created from the string "1.0.0-A1".

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0+B1";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `stringOf()` method returns the original version string when called with a `Version` object. Since the original version string is "1.0.0", the `stringOf()` method should return "1.0.0" when called with a `Version` object created from the string "1.0.0+B1". Therefore, the follow-up input is a `Version` object created from the string "1.0.0+B1".
