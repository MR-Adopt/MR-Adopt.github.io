## New input pair0:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input is `value = 0L`. The corresponding follow-up input is `message = encrypt(value)`, which encrypts the value 0L using the `encrypt` method and assigns the result to the variable `message`. The `message` variable is then used as the input for the `decrypt` method, along with the class `Long`, to decrypt the encrypted value and compare it with the original value. Since the original value is 0L, the decrypted value should also be 0L, and the assertion `assertEquals(value.longValue(), decryptedValue.longValue())` will pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Long value = 99999L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input is `value = 99999L`. The corresponding follow-up input is `message = encrypt(value)`, which encrypts the value 99999L using the `encrypt` method and assigns the result to the variable `message`. The `message` variable is then used as the input for the `decrypt` method, along with the class `Long`, to decrypt the encrypted value and compare it with the original value. Since the original value is 99999L, the decrypted value should also be 99999L, and the assertion `assertEquals(value.longValue(), decryptedValue.longValue())` will pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input is `value = -1L`. The corresponding follow-up input is `message = encrypt(value)`, which encrypts the value -1L using the `encrypt` method and assigns the result to the variable `message`. The `message` variable is then used as the input for the `decrypt` method, along with the class `Long`, to decrypt the encrypted value and compare it with the original value. Since the original value is -1L, the decrypted value should also be -1L, and the assertion `assertEquals(value.longValue(), decryptedValue.longValue())` will pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input is `value = Long.MAX_VALUE`. The corresponding follow-up input is `message = encrypt(value)`, which encrypts the value Long.MAX_VALUE using the `encrypt` method and assigns the result to the variable `message`. The `message` variable is then used as the input for the `decrypt` method, along with the class `Long`, to decrypt the encrypted value and compare it with the original value. Since the original value is Long.MAX_VALUE, the decrypted value should also be Long.MAX_VALUE, and the assertion `assertEquals(value.longValue(), decryptedValue.longValue())` will pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: The new source input is `value = Long.MIN_VALUE`. The corresponding follow-up input is `message = encrypt(value)`, which encrypts the value Long.MIN_VALUE using the `encrypt` method and assigns the result to the variable `message`. The `message` variable is then used as the input for the `decrypt` method, along with the class `Long`, to decrypt the encrypted value and compare it with the original value. Since the original value is Long.MIN_VALUE, the decrypted value should also be Long.MIN_VALUE, and the assertion `assertEquals(value.longValue(), decryptedValue.longValue())` will pass.
