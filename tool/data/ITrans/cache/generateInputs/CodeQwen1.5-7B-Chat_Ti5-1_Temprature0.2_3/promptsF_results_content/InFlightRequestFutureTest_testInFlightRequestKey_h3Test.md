## New input pair0:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the group is an empty string in both cases, the hashCode of the two objects should be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", -1, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", -1, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the partition is -1 in both cases, the hashCode of the two objects should be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, -1);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, -1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the offset is -1 in both cases, the hashCode of the two objects should be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the partition is Integer.MAX_VALUE in both cases, the hashCode of the two objects should be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the offset is Integer.MAX_VALUE in both cases, the hashCode of the two objects should be equal.
