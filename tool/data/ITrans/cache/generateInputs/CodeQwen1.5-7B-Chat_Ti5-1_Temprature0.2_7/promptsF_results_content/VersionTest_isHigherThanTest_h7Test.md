## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha1";
    String v2 = "1.0-alpha2";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha1";
    String v2 = v1.replace("alpha1", "alpha2");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. For example, "1.0-alpha1" is considered lower than "1.0-alpha2". Therefore, when we change the patch level from "alpha1" to "alpha2", the version number becomes higher.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = v1.replace("0", "1");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. For example, "1.0.0" is considered lower than "1.0.1". Therefore, when we increment the patch level from "0" to "1", the version number becomes higher.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-beta1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-beta2";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-beta1";
    String v2 = v1.replace("beta1", "beta2");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. For example, "1.0.0-beta1" is considered lower than "1.0.0-beta2". Therefore, when we change the patch level from "beta1" to "beta2", the version number becomes higher.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-rc1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-rc2";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-rc1";
    String v2 = v1.replace("rc1", "rc2");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. For example, "1.0.0-rc1" is considered lower than "1.0.0-rc2". Therefore, when we change the patch level from "rc1" to "rc2", the version number becomes higher.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0+build1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0+build2";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0+build1";
    String v2 = v1.replace("build1", "build2");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are compared lexicographically. For example, "1.0.0+build1" is considered lower than "1.0.0+build2". Therefore, when we change the patch level from "build1" to "build2", the version number becomes higher.
