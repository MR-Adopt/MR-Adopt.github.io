## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLOWORLD";
    String textTodecrypt = "VHJJQYJYJ";
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAMMING";
    String textTodecrypt = "JJJJJJJJJ";
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ENCRYPTION");
    String plaintext = "TESTCASE";
    String textTodecrypt = "JJJJJJJJJ";
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("DEMO");
    String plaintext = "DEMOGRAPHICS";
    String textTodecrypt = "JJJJJJJJJ";
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("CIPHER");
    String plaintext = "ENCRYPT";
    String textTodecrypt = "JJJJJJJJJ";
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input0:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input1:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input2:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input3:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input4:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText;
```

## Explanation of inferred relation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted text generated from the plaintext of each new source input should be the same as the follow-up input. This is because the encryption and decryption processes are reversible, and the decryption process will return the original plaintext. Therefore, if the encrypted text of a new source input is the same as the follow-up input, it means that the decryption process has been correctly implemented.
