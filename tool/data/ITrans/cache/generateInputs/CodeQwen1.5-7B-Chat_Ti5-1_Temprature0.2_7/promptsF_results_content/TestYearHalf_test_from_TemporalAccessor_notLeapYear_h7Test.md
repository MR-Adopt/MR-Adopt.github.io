## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the `date` and `year` values. Since the `date` and `year` values are provided in the original test case, the `expected` value can be calculated using the same formula. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
