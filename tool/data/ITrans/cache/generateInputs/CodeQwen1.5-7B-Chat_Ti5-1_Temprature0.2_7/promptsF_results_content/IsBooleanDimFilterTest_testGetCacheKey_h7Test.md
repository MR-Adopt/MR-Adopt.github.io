## New input pair0:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `getCacheKey()` method of `IsFalseDimFilter` returns the same array for two `EqualityFilter` objects with the same column name, value, and filter context. Since the column name and value are different in the new source input, the `getCacheKey()` method will return different arrays for the two `EqualityFilter` objects.

## New input pair1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `getCacheKey()` method of `IsFalseDimFilter` returns the same array for two `EqualityFilter` objects with the same column name, value, and filter context. Since the column type is different in the new source input, the `getCacheKey()` method will return different arrays for the two `EqualityFilter` objects.

## New input pair2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");

## New input pair4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    f3.setFilterContext("world");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
