## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements should be normalized by removing extra spaces, tabs, and newlines, and replacing single quotes with double quotes. The new input pair satisfies this relation by removing the extra spaces and tabs in the original SQL statement.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 2);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 2);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements should be normalized by removing extra spaces, tabs, and newlines, and replacing single quotes with double quotes. The new input pair satisfies this relation by removing the extra spaces and tabs in the original SQL statement.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 0);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 0);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements should be normalized by removing extra spaces, tabs, and newlines, and replacing single quotes with double quotes. The new input pair satisfies this relation by removing the extra spaces and tabs in the original SQL statement.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 3);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements should be normalized by removing extra spaces, tabs, and newlines, and replacing single quotes with double quotes. The new input pair satisfies this relation by removing the extra spaces and tabs in the original SQL statement.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 4);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 4);";
```
The inferred relation is that the SQL statements should be normalized by removing extra spaces, tabs, and newlines, and replacing single quotes with double quotes. The new input pair satisfies this relation by removing the extra spaces and tabs in the original SQL statement.
