## New input pair1:
```java
    String element2 = "C";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
String element2 = "C";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is an element to be added to the set, and the follow-up input is a different element to be added to the set. Since the source input is `element` and the follow-up input is `element2`, we can infer that the source input is an element to be added to the set, and the follow-up input is a different element to be added to the set. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String element2 = "D";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
String element2 = "D";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is an element to be added to the set, and the follow-up input is a different element to be added to the set. Since the source input is `element` and the follow-up input is `element2`, we can infer that the source input is an element to be added to the set, and the follow-up input is a different element to be added to the set. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String element2 = "E";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
String element2 = "E";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is an element to be added to the set, and the follow-up input is a different element to be added to the set. Since the source input is `element` and the follow-up input is `element2`, we can infer that the source input is an element to be added to the set, and the follow-up input is a different element to be added to the set. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
