# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input0:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the inferred relation is satisfied.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the inferred relation is satisfied.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the inferred relation is satisfied.

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1800;
    int year3 = 1800;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1800;
    int year3 = 1800;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the inferred relation is satisfied.

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2050;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2050;
    int year3 = 2050;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input4:
```java
    int year1 = 2050;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2050;
    int year3 = 2050;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the inferred relation is satisfied.
