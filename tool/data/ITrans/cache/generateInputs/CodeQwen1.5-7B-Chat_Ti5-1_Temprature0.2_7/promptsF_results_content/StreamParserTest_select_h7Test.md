## New input pair0:
```java
    StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
    String queryTitle = "p";
    String queryTitle2 = "p";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `queryTitle2` should be the same as `queryTitle` because the original test case is testing the `selectFirst` method, which returns the first matching element based on the provided query. Since the original test case is using the same query for both `expectFirst` and `selectFirst`, the inferred relation is that `queryTitle2` should be the same as `queryTitle`.

## New input pair1:
```java

    String queryTitle = "#1";
    String queryTitle2 = "#1";
```
