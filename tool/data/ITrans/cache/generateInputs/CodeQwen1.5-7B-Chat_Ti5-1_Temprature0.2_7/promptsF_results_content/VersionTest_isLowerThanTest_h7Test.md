## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1.1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = v1 + ".1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version with the same major, minor, and revision, but with an incremented build number. The new input pair satisfies this relation because the build number is incremented by 1 from the original version.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0.1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = v1 + ".1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version with the same major, minor, and revision, but with an incremented build number. The new input pair satisfies this relation because the build number is incremented by 1 from the original version.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1.1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = v1 + ".1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version with the same major, minor, revision, and build number, but with an incremented build number. The new input pair satisfies this relation because the build number is incremented by 1 from the original version.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "2.1";
    String v2 = "2.1.1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "2.1";
    String v2 = v1 + ".1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version with the same major, minor, and revision, but with an incremented build number. The new input pair satisfies this relation because the build number is incremented by 1 from the original version.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "2.1-A1";
    String v2 = "2.1-A1.1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String v1 = "2.1-A1";
    String v2 = v1 + ".1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a valid version, then `v2` is a valid version with the same major, minor, revision, and build number, but with an incremented build number. The new input pair satisfies this relation because the build number is incremented by 1 from the original version.
