## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object. Therefore, for a given `date` object, the `expected` value can be calculated by subtracting 1 from the month value, dividing it by 6, and adding 1. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it provides a valid `year` and `expected` value based on the `date` object.
