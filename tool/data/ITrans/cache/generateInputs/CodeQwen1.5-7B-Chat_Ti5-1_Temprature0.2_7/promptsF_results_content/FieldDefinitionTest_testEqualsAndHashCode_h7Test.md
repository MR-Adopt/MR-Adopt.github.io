# REQUIRED DELIVERABLE
## New input pair0:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("bar", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("bar", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of a FieldDefinition object is equal to the hashCode of another FieldDefinition object if and only if they have the same name and type. Since "bar" is different from "foo", the hashCode of the subject and other3 should be different.

## New input pair1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.INT);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of a FieldDefinition object is equal to the hashCode of another FieldDefinition object if and only if they have the same name and type. Since "foo" is different from "INT", the hashCode of the subject and other3 should be different.

## New input pair2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of a FieldDefinition object is equal to the hashCode of another FieldDefinition object if and only if they have the same name and type. Since both subject and other3 have the same name and type, the hashCode of the subject and other3 should be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of a FieldDefinition object is equal to the hashCode of another FieldDefinition object if and only if they have the same name and type. Since "foo" is the same as "foo" and the only difference is the description, the hashCode of the subject and other3 should be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDefaultValue("default");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of a FieldDefinition object is equal to the hashCode of another FieldDefinition object if and only if they have the same name and type. Since "foo" is the same as "foo" and the only difference is the default value, the hashCode of the subject and other3 should be equal.
