## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `fromCloseable` method should return a `ResourceHolder` that holds the same `Closeable` object as the input. Since the input is a lambda expression that does not throw any exceptions, the `fromCloseable` method should return a `ResourceHolder` that holds the same lambda expression.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `fromCloseable` method should return a `ResourceHolder` that holds the same `Closeable` object as the input. Since the input is a custom `Closeable` class that throws an `IOException` when closed, the `fromCloseable` method should return a `ResourceHolder` that holds the same custom `Closeable` class.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
