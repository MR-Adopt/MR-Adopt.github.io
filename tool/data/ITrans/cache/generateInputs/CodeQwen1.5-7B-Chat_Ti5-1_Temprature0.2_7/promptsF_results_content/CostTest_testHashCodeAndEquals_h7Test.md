## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since `subject` and `other` have the same value (0), their hashCodes should also be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since `subject` and `other` have the same value (100), their hashCodes should also be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(999);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(999);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since `subject` and `other` have the same value (999), their hashCodes should also be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since `subject` and `other` have the same value (1000), their hashCodes should also be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects with the same value should be the same. Since `subject` and `other` have the same value (Integer.MAX_VALUE), their hashCodes should also be the same.
