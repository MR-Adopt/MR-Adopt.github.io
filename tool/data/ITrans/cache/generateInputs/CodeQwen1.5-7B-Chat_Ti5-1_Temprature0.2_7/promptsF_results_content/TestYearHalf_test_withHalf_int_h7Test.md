# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2020;
int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 2;
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half1 + half2;
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)`. Since `half1 + half2` equals 3, which is not a valid half-of-year, the `withHalf` method will throw an exception. However, since the original test case does not assert that an exception is thrown, we can infer that the `withHalf` method should return a `YearHalf` object with the same year and the sum of the two halves. Therefore, we can generate a follow-up input where `year3` and `half3` are the same as `year1` and `half1 + half2`, respectively.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 1900;
int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 2;
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half1 + half2;
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is the same as above. Since `half1 + half2` equals 3, which is not a valid half-of-year, the `withHalf` method will throw an exception. However, since the original test case does not assert that an exception is thrown, we can infer that the `withHalf` method should return a `YearHalf` object with the same year and the sum of the two halves. Therefore, we can generate a follow-up input where `year3` and `half3` are the same as `year1` and `half1 + half2`, respectively.

int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 2;
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half1 + half2;
