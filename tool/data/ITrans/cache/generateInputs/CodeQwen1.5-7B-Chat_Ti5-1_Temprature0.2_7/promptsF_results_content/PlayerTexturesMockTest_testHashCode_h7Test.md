## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `hashCode()` method of `PlayerTexturesMock` is based on the `ProfileProperty` object obtained by calling `getProperty()`. Since the `ProfileProperty` object is not affected by the URL of the skin, the hash codes of the two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects should be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `hashCode()` method of `PlayerTexturesMock` is based on the `ProfileProperty` object obtained by calling `getProperty()`. Since the `ProfileProperty` object is not affected by the absence of a skin URL, the hash codes of the two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects should be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `hashCode()` method of `PlayerTexturesMock` is based on the `ProfileProperty` object obtained by calling `getProperty()`. Since the `ProfileProperty` object is not affected by the URLs of the skin and cape, the hash codes of the two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects should be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `hashCode()` method of `PlayerTexturesMock` is based on the `ProfileProperty` object obtained by calling `getProperty()`. Since the `ProfileProperty` object is not affected by the multiple calls to `setSkin()`, the hash codes of the two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects should be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setProfile(new Profile(UUID.randomUUID(), "username"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProfile(new Profile(UUID.randomUUID(), "username"));
```
### Explanation:
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `hashCode()` method of `PlayerTexturesMock` is based on the `ProfileProperty` object obtained by calling `getProperty()`. Since the `ProfileProperty` object is not affected by the change in the `Profile` object, the hash codes of the two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects should be the same.
