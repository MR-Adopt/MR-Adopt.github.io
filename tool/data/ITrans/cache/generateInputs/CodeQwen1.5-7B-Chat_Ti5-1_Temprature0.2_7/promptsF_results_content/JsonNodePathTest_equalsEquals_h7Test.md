## New input pair0:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
    String token2 = "b";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "b" and `token2` is "b", `a1` and `a2` should be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String token1 = "1";
    String token2 = "1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(Integer.parseInt(token1));
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(Integer.parseInt(token2));
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "1" and `token2` is "1", `a1` and `a2` should be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String token1 = "a/b";
    String token2 = "a/b";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "a/b" and `token2` is "a/b", `a1` and `a2` should be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String token1 = "";
    String token2 = "";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "" and `token2` is "", `a1` and `a2` should be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String token1 = "a%20b";
    String token2 = "a%20b";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` should be equal if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "a%20b" and `token2` is "a%20b", `a1` and `a2` should be equal.
