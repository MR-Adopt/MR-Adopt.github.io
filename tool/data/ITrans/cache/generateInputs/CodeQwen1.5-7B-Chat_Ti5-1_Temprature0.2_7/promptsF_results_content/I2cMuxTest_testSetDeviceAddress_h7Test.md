## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux2", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux2.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the new source input pair0 is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class is being called on a new instance of the `I2cMux` class (`i2cMux2`), with the same `deviceAddress` as the original test case. This ensures that the `deviceAddress` is set correctly on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class. The `assertEquals` assertion is used to verify that the `deviceAddress` is correctly set on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class.

## New input pair1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux2", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux2.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the new source input pair1 is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class is being called on a new instance of the `I2cMux` class (`i2cMux2`), with a different `deviceAddress` than the original test case. This ensures that the `deviceAddress` is set correctly on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class. The `assertEquals` assertion is used to verify that the `deviceAddress` is correctly set on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class.

## New input pair2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7F";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux2", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux2.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the new source input pair2 is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class is being called on a new instance of the `I2cMux` class (`i2cMux2`), with a different `deviceAddress` than the original test case. This ensures that the `deviceAddress` is set correctly on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class. The `assertEquals` assertion is used to verify that the `deviceAddress` is correctly set on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class.

## New input pair3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7E";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux2", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux2.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the new source input pair3 is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class is being called on a new instance of the `I2cMux` class (`i2cMux2`), with a different `deviceAddress` than the original test case. This ensures that the `deviceAddress` is set correctly on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class. The `assertEquals` assertion is used to verify that the `deviceAddress` is correctly set on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class.

## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x70";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux2", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux2.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the new source input pair4 is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class is being called on a new instance of the `I2cMux` class (`i2cMux2`), with the same `deviceAddress` as the original test case. This ensures that the `deviceAddress` is set correctly on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class. The `assertEquals` assertion is used to verify that the `deviceAddress` is correctly set on the new instance of the `I2cMux` class.
