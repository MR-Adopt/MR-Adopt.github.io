## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `JobKey` returned by `getKey()` method of `JobDetail` is the same as the `JobKey` passed to the `withIdentity()` method of `JobBuilder`. Since the `JobKey` is immutable, it cannot change after it is created. Therefore, the `JobKey` returned by `getKey()` method is the same as the `JobKey` passed to the `withIdentity()` method of `JobBuilder`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(MyJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(MyJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).build();
    JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```

## New input pair2:
```java

    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("This is a durable job").build();
    JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();

## New input pair3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withPriority(5).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withPriority(5).build();
    JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();

## New input pair4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTriggers(newTrigger().withIdentity("trigger1", "group1").startNow().build()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTriggers(newTrigger().withIdentity("trigger1", "group1").startNow().build()).build();
