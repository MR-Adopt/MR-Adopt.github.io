## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text input is consistent with the output of the method under test.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1999-h1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text input is consistent with the output of the method under test.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2050;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2050-h2";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2050;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text input is consistent with the output of the method under test.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2100-h1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text input is consistent with the output of the method under test.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h2";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text input is consistent with the output of the method under test.
