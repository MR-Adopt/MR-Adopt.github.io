# New input pair0:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be able to be decrypted back to the original source input. Since the source input is 0L, the encrypted value will be the same as the original source input. Therefore, the follow-up input is the encrypted value of the source input.

# New input pair1:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be able to be decrypted back to the original source input. Since the source input is Long.MAX_VALUE, the encrypted value will be the same as the original source input. Therefore, the follow-up input is the encrypted value of the source input.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be able to be decrypted back to the original source input. Since the source input is -1L, the encrypted value will be the same as the original source input. Therefore, the follow-up input is the encrypted value of the source input.

# New input pair3:
```java
    Long value = 100L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be able to be decrypted back to the original source input. Since the source input is 100L, the encrypted value will be the same as the original source input. Therefore, the follow-up input is the encrypted value of the source input.

# New input pair4:
```java
    Long value = null;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be able to be decrypted back to the original source input. Since the source input is null, the encrypted value will be the same as the original source input. Therefore, the follow-up input is the encrypted value of the source input.
