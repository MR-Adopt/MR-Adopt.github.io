## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the method under test is that the `normalizeSql` method is used to normalize the SQL statements before comparing them. The `normalizeSql` method replaces various whitespace characters, single quotes, and parentheses with their corresponding whitespace characters, double quotes, and parentheses, respectively.

The new source input `sql` is a valid SQL statement that creates a table with a string column `a` and a bigint column `b`, and specifies the row format and storage format. The corresponding follow-up input `newSql` is the same as `sql` but with the column names separated by commas instead of spaces.

The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `normalizeSql` method is used to normalize the SQL statements before comparing them, and the new SQL statement has the same column names separated by commas as the original SQL statement.
