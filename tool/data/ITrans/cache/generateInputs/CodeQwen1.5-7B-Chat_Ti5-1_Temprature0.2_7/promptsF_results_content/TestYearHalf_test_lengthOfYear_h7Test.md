# New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the year are passed to the `YearHalf.of()` method to create a new `YearHalf` object. The `lengthOfYear()` method is then called on the `test2` object to get the length of the year, which is expected to be 366 since 2020 is a leap year.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the year are passed to the `YearHalf.of()` method to create a new `YearHalf` object. The `lengthOfYear()` method is then called on the `test2` object to get the length of the year, which is expected to be 365 since 1900 is not a leap year.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 2);
```

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1600;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1600, 1);

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
