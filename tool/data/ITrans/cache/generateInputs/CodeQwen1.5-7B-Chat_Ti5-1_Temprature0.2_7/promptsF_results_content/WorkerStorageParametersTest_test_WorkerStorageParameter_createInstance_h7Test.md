## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = true;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. Since `l` is 0, the follow-up input `l2` should also be 0. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and can be any value.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. Since `l` is -1, the follow-up input `l2` should also be -1. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and can be any value.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = true;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. Since `l` is `Long.MAX_VALUE`, the follow-up input `l2` should also be `Long.MAX_VALUE`. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and can be any value.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = 1;
    long l2 = 1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 1;
    long l2 = 1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. Since `l` is 1, the follow-up input `l2` should also be 1. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and can be any value.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
    long l2 = 500000000;
    boolean b = true;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
    long l2 = 500000000;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input. Since `l` is 500000000, the follow-up input `l2` should also be 500000000. The boolean `b` is not related to the source input and can be any value.
