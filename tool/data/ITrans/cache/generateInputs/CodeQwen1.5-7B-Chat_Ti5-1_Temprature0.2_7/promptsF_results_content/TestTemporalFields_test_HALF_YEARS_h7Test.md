# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 1;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 2;
int amount = 1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the quarter of the year is incremented by 1 for each new input pair. In this case, the source input is `year1 = 2023` and `quarter1 = 1`, which corresponds to the first quarter of 2023. The follow-up input is `year2 = 2023` and `quarter2 = 2`, which corresponds to the second quarter of 2023. The `amount` is set to 1, which indicates that the difference between the two quarters is 1.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 2;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 3;
int amount = 1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the quarter of the year is incremented by 1 for each new input pair. In this case, the source input is `year1 = 2023` and `quarter1 = 2`, which corresponds to the second quarter of 2023. The follow-up input is `year2 = 2023` and `quarter2 = 3`, which corresponds to the third quarter of 2023. The `amount` is set to 1, which indicates that the difference between the two quarters is 1.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 3;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 4;
int amount = 1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the quarter of the year is incremented by 1 for each new input pair. In this case, the source input is `year1 = 2023` and `quarter1 = 3`, which corresponds to the third quarter of 2023. The follow-up input is `year2 = 2023` and `quarter2 = 4`, which corresponds to the fourth quarter of 2023. The `amount` is set to 1, which indicates that the difference between the two quarters is 1.

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 4;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 1;
int amount = 1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the quarter of the year is incremented by 1 for each new input pair. In this case, the source input is `year1 = 2023` and `quarter1 = 4`, which corresponds to the fourth quarter of 2023. The follow-up input is `year2 = 2023` and `quarter2 = 1`, which corresponds to the first quarter of 2023. The `amount` is set to 1, which indicates that the difference between the two quarters is 1.

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 5;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 5;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 1;
int amount = 1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the quarter of the year is incremented by 1 for each new input pair. In this case, the source input is `year1 = 2023` and `quarter1 = 5`, which corresponds to an invalid quarter of the year. The follow-up input is `year2 = 2023` and `quarter2 = 1`, which corresponds to the first quarter of 2023. The `amount` is set to 1, which indicates that the difference between the two quarters is 1.
