## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.1";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.1";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since the source input `v1` is `"1.0.1"`, the follow-up input `v2` should also be `"1.0.1"` to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since the source input `v1` is `"1.1.0-A1"`, the follow-up input `v2` should also be `"1.1.0-A1"` to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since the source input `v1` is `"1.0-A1"`, the follow-up input `v2` should also be `"1.0-A1"` to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.1-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.1-A1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.1-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.1-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since the source input `v1` is `"1.0.1-A1"`, the follow-up input `v2` should also be `"1.0.1-A1"` to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since the source input `v1` is `"1.0.0-A1"`, the follow-up input `v2` should also be `"1.0.0-A1"` to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.
