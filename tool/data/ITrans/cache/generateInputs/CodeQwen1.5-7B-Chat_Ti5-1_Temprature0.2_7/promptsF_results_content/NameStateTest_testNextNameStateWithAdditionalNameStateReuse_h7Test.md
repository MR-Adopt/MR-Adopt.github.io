## New input pair0:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
    String key2 = "key1";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `getNextNameState` method returns the `nextNameState` associated with the `key` in the `nameState` object. Since `key` is "key1", the `nextNameState` associated with "key1" in `nameState` is `nextNameState`. Therefore, the `getNextNameState` method should return `nextNameState` when called with `key2` as the argument.

## New input pair1:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "";
    String key2 = "";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `getNextNameState` method returns the `nextNameState` associated with the `key` in the `nameState` object. Since `key` is an empty string, the `nextNameState` associated with an empty string in `nameState` is `nextNameState`. Therefore, the `getNextNameState` method should return `nextNameState` when called with `key2` as the argument.

## New input pair2:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = null;
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = null;
    String key = "key";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `getNextNameState` method returns the `nextNameState` associated with the `key` in the `nameState` object. Since `nextNameState` is `null`, the `getNextNameState` method should return `null` when called with `key2` as the argument.

## New input pair3:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `getNextNameState` method returns the `nextNameState` associated with the `key` in the `nameState` object. Since `key` is "key", the `nextNameState` associated with "key" in `nameState` is `nextNameState`. Therefore, the `getNextNameState` method should return `nextNameState` when called with `key2` as the argument.

## New input pair4:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key with spaces";
    String key2 = "key with spaces";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation code:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key with spaces";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `getNextNameState` method returns the `nextNameState` associated with the `key` in the `nameState` object. Since `key` contains spaces, the `nextNameState` associated with a key containing spaces in `nameState` is `nextNameState`. Therefore, the `getNextNameState` method should return `nextNameState` when called with `key2` as the argument.
