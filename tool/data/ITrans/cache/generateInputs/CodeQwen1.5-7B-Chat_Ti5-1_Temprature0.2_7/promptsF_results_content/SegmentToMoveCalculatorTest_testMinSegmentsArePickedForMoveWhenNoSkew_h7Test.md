## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
New follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the total number of segments in the tier is directly related to the number of segments that should be moved in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 0, the number of segments that should be moved in the tier should also be 0.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
New follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the total number of segments in the tier is directly related to the number of segments that should be moved in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 100, the number of segments that should be moved in the tier should also be 100.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
New follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the total number of segments in the tier is directly related to the number of segments that should be moved in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 10000, the number of segments that should be moved in the tier should also be 10000.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
New follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the total number of segments in the tier is directly related to the number of segments that should be moved in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is Integer.MAX_VALUE, the number of segments that should be moved in the tier should also be Integer.MAX_VALUE.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 20000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
New follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 20000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the total number of segments in the tier is directly related to the number of segments that should be moved in the tier. Since the total number of segments in the tier is 20000, the number of segments that should be moved in the tier should also be 20000.
