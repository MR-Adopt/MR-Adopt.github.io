## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.1.1";
    long ipLong2 = 3232235777L;
```
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should return `ipLong2`. To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert `ipStr1` to its long representation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 167772161L;
```
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should return `ipLong2`. To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert `ipStr1` to its long representation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 2886723581L;
```
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should return `ipLong2`. To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert `ipStr1` to its long representation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "8.8.8.8";
    long ipLong2 = 134744072L;
```
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should return `ipLong2`. To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert `ipStr1` to its long representation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "0.0.0.0";
    long ipLong2 = 0L;
```
The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` should return `ipLong2`. To generate the follow-up input, we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert `ipStr1` to its long representation.
