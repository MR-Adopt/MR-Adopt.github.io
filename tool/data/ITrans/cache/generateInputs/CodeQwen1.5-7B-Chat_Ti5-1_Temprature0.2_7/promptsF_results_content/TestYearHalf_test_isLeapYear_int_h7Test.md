## New input pair0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2020;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2020;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input is used to create a `YearHalf` object, and the follow-up input is used to test the `isLeapYear` method of the `YearHalf` object. Since the source input `year` is 2020, which is a leap year, the `isLeapYear` method should return `true` when called on the `YearHalf` object created from the source input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 1900;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 1900;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input is used to create a `YearHalf` object, and the follow-up input is used to test the `isLeapYear` method of the `YearHalf` object. Since the source input `year` is 1900, which is not a leap year, the `isLeapYear` method should return `false` when called on the `YearHalf` object created from the source input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2100;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2100;

Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input is used to create a `YearHalf` object, and the follow-up input is used to test the `isLeapYear` method of the `YearHalf` object.
