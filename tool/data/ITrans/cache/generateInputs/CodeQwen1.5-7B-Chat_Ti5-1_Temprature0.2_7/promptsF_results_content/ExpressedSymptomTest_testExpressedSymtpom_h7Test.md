# New input pair0:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "medicalModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "medicalModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "medicalModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `symptom` and `symptom2` objects are the same instance, and the `module` and `module2` variables are the same string. This is because the `addressSource` method is called on the `symptom` object with the same `module` parameter, which sets the `module` field of the `symptom` object. Since the `symptom` and `symptom2` objects are the same instance, the `module` field of `symptom2` is also set to the same value.
