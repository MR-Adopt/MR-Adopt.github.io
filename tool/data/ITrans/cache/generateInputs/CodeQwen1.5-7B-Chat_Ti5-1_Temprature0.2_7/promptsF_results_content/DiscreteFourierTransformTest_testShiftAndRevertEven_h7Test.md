Explanation: The original input is a 5x5 matrix with values ranging from 1 to 8. The method under test, `shift`, rearranges the elements of the matrix by shifting the first and second halves of the rows. The follow-up input, `shifted2`, is the result of applying the `shift` method to the original matrix. The symmetry in the DFT matrix ensures that the first half of the rows (and columns) are the complex conjugates of the second half. Therefore, the first and second halves of the rows (and columns) in `shifted2` are the complex conjugates of each other, and the zero-frequency term is in the middle.

Explanation: The original input is a 4x4 matrix with values ranging from 1 to 4. The method under test, `shift`, rearranges the elements of the matrix by shifting the first and second halves of the rows. The follow-up input, `shifted2`, is the result of applying the `shift` method to the original matrix. The symmetry in the DFT matrix ensures that the first half of the rows (and columns) are the complex conjugates of the second half.

Explanation: The original input is a 1x1 matrix with a single value of 1. The method under test, `shift`, rearranges the elements of the matrix by shifting the first and second halves of the rows. The follow-up input, `shifted2`, is the result of applying the `shift` method to the original matrix. The symmetry in the DFT matrix ensures that the first half of the rows (and columns) are the complex conjugates of the second half.
