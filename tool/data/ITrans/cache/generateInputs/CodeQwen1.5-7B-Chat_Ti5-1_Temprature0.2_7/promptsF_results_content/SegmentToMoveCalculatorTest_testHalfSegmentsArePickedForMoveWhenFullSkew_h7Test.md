## New input pair0:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Generation code:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `tier` and `historicals` are the same for both. This is because the original test case is testing the behavior of the method when the full skew is present, which means that all historicals have the same number of segments. Therefore, the follow-up input is also testing the behavior of the method when the full skew is present, which means that all historicals have the same number of segments.
