## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";

```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the job names generated from the task IDs should be different. Since the task IDs are different, the job names should also be different. The code to generate the follow-up input is simply using the same task ID for both source and follow-up inputs.
