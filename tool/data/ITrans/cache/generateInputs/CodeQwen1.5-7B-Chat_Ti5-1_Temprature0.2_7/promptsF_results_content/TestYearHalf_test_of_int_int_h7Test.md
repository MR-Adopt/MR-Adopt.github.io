## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created with the original source input should be equal to the object created with the new source input. The new source input satisfies this relation because it has the same year and half value as the original source input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created with the original source input should be equal to the object created with the new source input. The new source input satisfies this relation because it has the same year and half value as the original source input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 5000;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created with the original source input should be equal to the object created with the new source input. The new source input satisfies this relation because it has the same year and half value as the original source input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1;
    int half = 3;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created with the original source input should be equal to the object created with the new source input. The new source input satisfies this relation because it has the same year and half value as the original source input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = -1;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created with the original source input should be equal to the object created with the new source input. The new source input satisfies this relation because it has the same year and half value as the original source input.
