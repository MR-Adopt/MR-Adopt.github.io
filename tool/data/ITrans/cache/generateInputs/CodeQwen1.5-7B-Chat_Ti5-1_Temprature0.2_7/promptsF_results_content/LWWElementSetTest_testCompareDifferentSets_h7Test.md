## New input pair0:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: The new source input `element2` is generated by modifying the original source input `element` by changing the key to "key2" and the timestamp to 2. This satisfies the inferred relation that the new source input should be different from the original source input in terms of key and timestamp.
