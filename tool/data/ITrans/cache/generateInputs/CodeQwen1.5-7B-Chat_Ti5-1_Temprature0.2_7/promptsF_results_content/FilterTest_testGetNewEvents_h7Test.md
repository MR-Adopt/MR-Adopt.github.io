# New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the original test case and the new input pair is that the `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are the same event. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by using the same event for both `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2`.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "Type2", "Description2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "Type2", "Description2");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "Type2", "Description2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "Type2", "Description2");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the original test case and the new input pair is that the `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are the same event. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by using the same event for both `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2`.

# New input pair3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "Description3");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "Description3");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "Description3");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "Description3");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the original test case and the new input pair is that the `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are the same event. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by using the same event for both `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2`.

# New input pair4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the original test case and the new input pair is that the `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are the same event. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by using the same event for both `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2`.

# New input pair5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the original test case and the new input pair is that the `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are the same event. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation by using the same event for both `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2`.
