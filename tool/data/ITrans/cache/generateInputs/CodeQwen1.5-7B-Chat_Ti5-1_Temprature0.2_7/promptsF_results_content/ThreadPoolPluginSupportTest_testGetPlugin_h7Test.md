## New input pair0:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new CustomThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "CustomThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Generation code:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new CustomThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "CustomThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is the same as the class name of the `plugin`. Since `CustomThreadPoolPlugin` is a custom plugin, its class name is "CustomThreadPoolPlugin".

## New input pair1:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new NullThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "NullThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Generation code:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new NullThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "NullThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is the same as the class name of the `plugin`. Since `NullThreadPoolPlugin` is a null plugin, its class name is "NullThreadPoolPlugin".

## New input pair2:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new EmptyThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "EmptyThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Generation code:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new EmptyThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "EmptyThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is the same as the class name of the `plugin`. Since `EmptyThreadPoolPlugin` is an empty plugin, its class name is "EmptyThreadPoolPlugin".

## New input pair3:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new LargeThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "LargeThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Generation code:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new LargeThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "LargeThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is the same as the class name of the `plugin`. Since `LargeThreadPoolPlugin` is a large plugin, its class name is "LargeThreadPoolPlugin".

## New input pair4:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new SmallThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "SmallThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Generation code:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new SmallThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "SmallThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is the same as the class name of the `plugin`. Since `SmallThreadPoolPlugin` is a small plugin, its class name is "SmallThreadPoolPlugin".
