## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "INSERT INTO TABLE_TEST_1(\n" + "\tDATE_ID,-- qianzhushi\n" + "\tCUS_NO -- houzhushi\n,\n" + "\tCUS_NAME\n" + ")\n" + "SELECT A.DATE_ID,\n" + "\tA.CUS_NO,\n" + "\tA.CUS_NAME\n" + "FROM TABLE_TEST_2 \n" + "WHERE COL1='1';";
    MySqlInsertStatement sqlStatement = (MySqlInsertStatement) SQLUtils.parseSingleStatement(sql, DbType.mysql, true);
    MySqlInsertStatement sqlStatement2 = (MySqlInsertStatement) SQLUtils.parseSingleStatement(sql, DbType.mysql, true);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the SQL statement and its parsed representation are identical. This is because the original test case is testing the functionality of adding comments to the columns of an INSERT statement and then parsing the modified statement to ensure that the comments are preserved. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation by parsing the same SQL statement twice and comparing the parsed representations.
