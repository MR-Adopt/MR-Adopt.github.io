## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be different for different retryCount and different storageAccount. Since retryCount1 and retryCount2 are both 0, the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be the same for both inputs.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be different for different retryCount and different storageAccount. Since retryCount1 and retryCount2 are both 5, the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be the same for both inputs.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be different for different retryCount and different storageAccount. Since retryCount1 and retryCount2 are both config.getMaxTries(), the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be the same for both inputs.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "new_account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "new_account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "new_account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "new_account";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be different for different retryCount and different storageAccount. Since retryCount1 and retryCount2 are both null, the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be the same for both inputs.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries() + 1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = config.getMaxTries() + 1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries() + 1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = config.getMaxTries() + 1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be different for different retryCount and different storageAccount. Since retryCount1 and retryCount2 are both config.getMaxTries() + 1, the blobServiceClient returned by getBlobServiceClient method should be the same for both inputs.
