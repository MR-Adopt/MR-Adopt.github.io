## New input1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value of the partition from 0 to 1, which is a different key than the original requestKey1.

## New input2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value of the offset from 0 to 1, which is a different key than the original requestKey1.

## New input3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it remains the same as the original requestKey1, which is a valid key.

## New input4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group1", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value of the group from "group" to "group1", which is a different key than the original requestKey1.

## New input5:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value of the partition and offset to the maximum possible values, which is a different key than the original requestKey1.
