## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(5, 1, Uniform.of(-10, 20));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(5);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 5x1 matrix with elements randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between -10 and 20. This is a common scenario for Fourier transforms, as real-world data often follows a normal distribution.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(7, 1, Uniform.of(-5, 15));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(7);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 7x1 matrix with elements randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between -5 and 15. This scenario is less common than the first input, but it still represents a valid input for the Fourier transform.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(3, 1, Uniform.of(-8, 12));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(3);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 3x1 matrix with elements randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between -8 and 12. This scenario is less common than the first two inputs, but it still represents a valid input for the Fourier transform.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(2, 1, Uniform.of(-3, 7));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(2);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 2x1 matrix with elements randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between -3 and 7. This scenario is less common than the first three inputs, but it still represents a valid input for the Fourier transform.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(1, 1, Uniform.of(-1, 1));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(1);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 1x1 matrix with a single element randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between -1 and 1. This is a simple scenario that can be used to verify the correctness of the Fourier transform.
