## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `retryCount1` is set to 0, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will ensure that a new client is created with the specified retry count.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `retryCount1` is set to 5, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will ensure that a new client is created with the specified retry count.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `retryCount1` is set to the maximum retry count specified in the `AzureAccountConfig` class. This will ensure that a new client is created with the specified retry count.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "new_account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `ACCOUNT1` is set to a new account name. This will ensure that a new client is created for a different storage account.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries() + 1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `retryCount1` is set to a value that is greater than the maximum retry count specified in the `AzureAccountConfig` class. This will ensure that a new client is created with the specified retry count.
