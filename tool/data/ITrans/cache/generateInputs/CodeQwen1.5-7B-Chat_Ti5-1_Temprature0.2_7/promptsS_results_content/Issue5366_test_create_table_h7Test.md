## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is the original test case provided. It demonstrates the creation of a table partition with specific modulus and remainder values.

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 2);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus and remainder values to 5 and 2, respectively. It explores a different scenario and ensures that the SQL statement is still valid.

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 0);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus to 6 and the remainder to 0. It explores a different scenario and ensures that the SQL statement is still valid.

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus to 7 and the remainder to 3. It explores a different scenario and ensures that the SQL statement is still valid.

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 4);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus to 8 and the remainder to 4. It explores a different scenario and ensures that the SQL statement is still valid.
