## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "456" and the value is "def". This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "ghi");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123". The new value is "ghi". This ensures that the map contains the key "123" with a different value.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", "jkl");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "789" and the value is "jkl". This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "mno");
    v01.put("456", "pqr");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the map. The keys are "123" and "456" and the values are "mno" and "pqr" respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least two key-value pairs.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "abc");
    v01.put("456", "def");
    v01.put("789", "ghi");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds three new key-value pairs to the map. The keys are "123", "456", and "789" and the values are "abc", "def", and "ghi" respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least three key-value pairs.
