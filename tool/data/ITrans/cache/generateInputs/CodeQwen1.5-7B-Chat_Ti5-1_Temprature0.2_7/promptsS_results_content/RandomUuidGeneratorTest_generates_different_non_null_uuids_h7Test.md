## New input1:
```java
UuidGenerator generator1 = new FixedUuidGenerator(UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input creates a `FixedUuidGenerator` with a random UUID. Since `FixedUuidGenerator` always returns the same UUID, it will generate the same UUID as the original test case. This input is not valid because it does not generate a different UUID than the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
UuidGenerator generator2 = new SequentialUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input creates a `SequentialUuidGenerator`, which generates UUIDs in a sequential order. Since `SequentialUuidGenerator` always generates the next UUID in the sequence, it will generate the same UUID as the original test case. This input is not valid because it does not generate a different UUID than the original test case.

## New input3:
```java
UuidGenerator generator3 = new NullUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input creates a `NullUuidGenerator`, which always returns `null`. Since `NullUuidGenerator` always returns `null`, it will generate the same UUID as the original test case. This input is not valid because it does not generate a different UUID than the original test case.

## New input4:
```java
UuidGenerator generator4 = new EmptyUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input creates an `EmptyUuidGenerator`, which always returns an empty UUID. Since `EmptyUuidGenerator` always returns an empty UUID, it will generate the same UUID as the original test case. This input is not valid because it does not generate a different UUID than the original test case.

## New input5:
```java
UuidGenerator generator5 = new UuidGenerator() {
    @Override
    public UUID generateId() {
        return UUID.fromString("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000");
    }
};
```
Explanation: This input creates a custom `UuidGenerator` that always returns a specific UUID. Since this UUID is the same as the original test case, it will generate the same UUID as the original test case. This input is not valid because it does not generate a different UUID than the original test case.
