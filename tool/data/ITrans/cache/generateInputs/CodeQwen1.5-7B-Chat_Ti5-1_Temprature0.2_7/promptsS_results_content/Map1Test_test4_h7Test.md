## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 3.14F);
    v01.put("102", 2.71F);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values are floating-point numbers. This is a common use case for maps in Java, and it ensures that the test case covers a variety of data types.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 0F);
    v01.put("102", 0F);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs with zero as the value. This is a common edge case for floating-point numbers, and it ensures that the test case covers a variety of edge cases.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", null);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains a null value in the map. This is a common edge case for maps in Java, and it ensures that the test case covers a variety of edge cases.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", Float.MAX_VALUE);
    v01.put("102", Float.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains the maximum and minimum values for a float. This is a common edge case for floating-point numbers, and it ensures that the test case covers a variety of edge cases.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", Float.NaN);
    v01.put("102", Float.NaN);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains NaN (Not a Number) values in the map. This is a common edge case for floating-point numbers, and it ensures that the test case covers a variety of edge cases.
