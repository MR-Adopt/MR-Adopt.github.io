## New input1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new element with a different key ("key2") and a different value (2) than the original element. This ensures that the `remove` method correctly removes the element from the set.

## New input2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new element with the same key ("key1") but a different value (0) than the original element. This ensures that the `remove` method correctly removes the element from the set.

## New input3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new element with the same key ("key1") and the same value (1) as the original element, but with a different bias value (bias + 1). This ensures that the `remove` method correctly removes the element from the set.

## New input4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias - 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new element with the same key ("key1") and the same value (1) as the original element, but with a different bias value (bias - 1). This ensures that the `remove` method correctly removes the element from the set.

## New input5:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new element with the same key ("key1") and a different value (2) than the original element. This ensures that the `remove` method correctly removes the element from the set.
