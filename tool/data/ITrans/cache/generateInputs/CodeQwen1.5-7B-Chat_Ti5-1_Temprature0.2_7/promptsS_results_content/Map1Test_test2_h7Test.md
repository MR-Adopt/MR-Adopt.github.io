## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map has a different key-value pair than the original input.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from 123L to 456L. This ensures that the map has a different value for the key "123" than the original input.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "789" and the value is 789L. This ensures that the map has a different key-value pair than the original input.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from 123L to 789L. This ensures that the map has a different value for the key "123" than the original input.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
    v01.put("789", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds three new key-value pairs to the map, where the keys are "123", "456", and "789", and the values are 123L, 456L, and 789L, respectively. This ensures that the map has a different key-value pair for each of the three keys.
