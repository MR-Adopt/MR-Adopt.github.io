## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the attribute name from "x" to "y". This change does not affect the function of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only depends on the `DimFilter` field.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the column type from `STRING` to `INTEGER`. This change does not affect the function of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only depends on the `DimFilter` field.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value from "hello" to "world". This change does not affect the function of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only depends on the `DimFilter` field.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a filter context. This change does not affect the function of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only depends on the `DimFilter` field.

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    f3.setFilterContext("world");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the filter context after creating the `EqualityFilter` object. This change does not affect the function of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only depends on the `DimFilter` field.
