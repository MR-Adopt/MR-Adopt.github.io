## New input1:
```java
    Class input = String.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the generic type from `Integer` to `String`, which is a different type. This ensures that the `TypeLiteral` is not normalized and the `normalize` method is tested.

## New input2:
```java
    Class input = List.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the generic type from `Integer` to `List`, which is a different type. This ensures that the `TypeLiteral` is not normalized and the `normalize` method is tested.

## New input3:
```java
    Class input = new TypeLiteral<List<Integer>>() {}.getRawType();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the generic type from `Integer` to `List`, which is a different type. This ensures that the `TypeLiteral` is not normalized and the `normalize` method is tested.

## New input4:
```java
    Class input = new TypeLiteral<List<String>>() {}.getRawType();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the generic type from `Integer` to `List`, which is a different type. This ensures that the `TypeLiteral` is not normalized and the `normalize` method is tested.

## New input5:
```java
    Class input = new TypeLiteral<List<String>>() {}.getClass();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the generic type from `Integer` to `List`, which is a different type. This ensures that the `TypeLiteral` is not normalized and the `normalize` method is tested.
