## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to 0, which means there will be no virtual threads to acquire pooled resources. This can be useful in testing scenarios where the pool is not used or when the number of threads is not relevant to the test.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to 1, which means there will be only one virtual thread to acquire pooled resources. This can be useful in testing scenarios where the pool is used by a single thread.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to 10, which means there will be ten virtual threads to acquire pooled resources. This can be useful in testing scenarios where the pool is used by multiple threads.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to 100, which means there will be one hundred virtual threads to acquire pooled resources. This can be useful in testing scenarios where the pool is used by a large number of threads.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the number of threads is set to the maximum value of an integer, which means there will be the maximum number of virtual threads to acquire pooled resources. This can be useful in testing scenarios where the pool is used by a very large number of threads.
