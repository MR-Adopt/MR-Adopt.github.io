## New input1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, a cost of 0 seconds is a valid input for the `subject`.

## New input2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, a cost of 100 seconds is a valid input for the `subject`.

## New input3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(999);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, a cost of 999 seconds is a valid input for the `subject`.

## New input4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, a cost of 1000 seconds is a valid input for the `subject`.

## New input5:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, a cost of the maximum value an integer can hold (2^31 - 1) seconds is a valid input for the `subject`.
