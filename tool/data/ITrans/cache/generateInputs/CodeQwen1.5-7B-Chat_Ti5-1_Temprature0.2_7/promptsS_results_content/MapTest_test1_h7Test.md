## New input1:
```java
    v01.put("123", 456);
    v01.put("12x", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the values associated with the keys "123" and "12x" to 456 and 789, respectively. This change in values ensures that the input is different from the original input, and it also satisfies the requirements of the test case.

## New input2:
```java
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("12x", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the values associated with the keys "123" and "12x" to 123 and 456, respectively. This change in values ensures that the input is different from the original input, and it also satisfies the requirements of the test case.

## New input3:
```java
    v01.put("123", 789);
    v01.put("12x", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the values associated with the keys "123" and "12x" to 789 and 123, respectively. This change in values ensures that the input is different from the original input, and it also satisfies the requirements of the test case.

## New input4:
```java
    v01.put("123", 456);
    v01.put("12x", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the values associated with the keys "123" and "12x" to 456 and 789, respectively. This change in values ensures that the input is different from the original input, and it also satisfies the requirements of the test case.

## New input5:
```java
    v01.put("123", 789);
    v01.put("12x", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the values associated with the keys "123" and "12x" to 789 and 456, respectively. This change in values ensures that the input is different from the original input, and it also satisfies the requirements of the test case.
