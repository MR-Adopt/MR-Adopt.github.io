## New input1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
Explanation: This input sets the skin URL to a different value, "https://github.com/skin1". This ensures that the hashCode() method will return a different value than the original input, as URLs with different values will result in different hash codes.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: This input sets the skin URL to null. This will cause the hashCode() method to return 0, as null values have a default hash code of 0.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: This input adds a cape URL to the playerTexturesMock object. This will result in a different hashCode() value than the original input, as URLs with different values will result in different hash codes.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Explanation: This input sets the skin URL to the same value twice. This will result in the same hashCode() value as the original input, as URLs with the same value will result in the same hash code.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setProfile(new Profile(UUID.randomUUID(), "username"));
```
Explanation: This input sets a different profile to the playerTexturesMock object. This will result in a different hashCode() value than the original input, as different profiles will result in different hash codes.
