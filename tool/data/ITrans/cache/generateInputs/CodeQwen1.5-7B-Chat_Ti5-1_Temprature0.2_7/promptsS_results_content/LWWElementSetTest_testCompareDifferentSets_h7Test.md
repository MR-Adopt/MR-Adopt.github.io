## New input1:
```java
Element element1 = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with a key "key1", a timestamp of 1, and the same bias as the original test case. This element is different from the original element in the set, as it has a different key.

## New input2:
```java
Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with a key "key2", a timestamp of 2, and the same bias as the original test case. This element is different from the original element in the set, as it has a different key.

## New input3:
```java
Element element3 = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the same key as the original element, but a timestamp of 2. This element is different from the original element in the set, as it has a different timestamp.

## New input4:
```java
Element element4 = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the same key and timestamp as the original element, but a different bias. This element is different from the original element in the set, as it has a different bias.

## New input5:
```java
Element element5 = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
element5.value = "newValue";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the same key, timestamp, and bias as the original element, but with a different value. This element is different from the original element in the set, as it has a different value.
