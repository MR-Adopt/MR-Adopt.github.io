## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates a `FilterEvent` with a unique event name, type, and description. This ensures that the event is different from the original mock event and can be processed by the `Filter` class.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "Type2", "Description2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates another `FilterEvent` with a different event name, type, and description. This ensures that the event is distinct from the first mock event and can be added to the `Filter` class.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "Description3");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates a third `FilterEvent` with a different event name, type, and description. This ensures that the event is unique from the other mock events and can be processed by the `Filter` class.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates a fourth `FilterEvent` with a different event name, type, and description. This ensures that the event is different from the previous mock events and can be added to the `Filter` class.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates a fifth `FilterEvent` with a different event name, type, and description. This ensures that the event is unique from the other mock events and can be processed by the `Filter` class.
