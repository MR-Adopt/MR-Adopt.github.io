## New input1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("bar", TokenType.STRING);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the name of the field from "foo" to "bar". This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it tests the behavior of the method under test when the name of the field changes.

## New input2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.INT);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the type of the field from STRING to INT. This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it tests the behavior of the method under test when the type of the field changes.

## New input3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it marks the field as deprecated. This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it tests the behavior of the method under test when the deprecation status of the field changes.

## New input4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a description to the field. This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it tests the behavior of the method under test when the description of the field changes.

## New input5:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDefaultValue("default");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets a default value for the field. This change is a different scenario from the original test case, as it tests the behavior of the method under test when the default value of the field changes.
