## New input1:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes two servers with the same number of segments as the original test case. This will ensure that the method under test will need to move segments between the two servers to balance the tier.

## New input2:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a server with no segments and a server with the same number of segments as the original test case. This will ensure that the method under test will need to move segments from the server with no segments to the server with the same number of segments to balance the tier.

## New input3:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes three servers with the same number of segments as the original test case. This will ensure that the method under test will need to move segments between the two servers with the same number of segments to balance the tier.

## New input4:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a server with no segments and two servers with the same number of segments as the original test case. This will ensure that the method under test will need to move segments from the server with no segments to the servers with the same number of segments to balance the tier.

## New input5:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes four servers with the same number of segments as the original test case. This will ensure that the method under test will need to move segments between the two servers with the same number of segments to balance the tier.
