## New input1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLOWORLD";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "SECRET" and a longer plaintext "HELLOWORLD". The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original test case to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAMMING";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a shorter keyword "JAVA" and a longer plaintext "PROGRAMMING". The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original test case to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ENCRYPTION");
    String plaintext = "TESTCASE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "ENCRYPTION" and a shorter plaintext "TESTCASE". The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original test case to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("DEMO");
    String plaintext = "DEMOGRAPHICS";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "DEMO" and a longer plaintext "DEMOGRAPHICS". The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original test case to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("CIPHER");
    String plaintext = "ENCRYPT";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "CIPHER" and a shorter plaintext "ENCRYPT". The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original test case to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.
