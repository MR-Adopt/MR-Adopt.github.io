## New input1:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because setting an empty string for the field name will not affect the hash code calculation, as the hash code is based on the concatenation of the full class name and the field name.

## New input2:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because setting an empty string for the full class name will not affect the hash code calculation, as the hash code is based on the concatenation of the full class name and the field name.

## New input3:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName1,testFullClassName2");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because setting a different full class name will affect the hash code calculation, as the hash code is based on the concatenation of the full class name and the field name.

## New input4:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because setting an empty string for the field name will not affect the hash code calculation, as the hash code is based on the concatenation of the full class name and the field name.

## New input5:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because setting an empty string for the full class name will not affect the hash code calculation, as the hash code is based on the concatenation of the full class name and the field name.
