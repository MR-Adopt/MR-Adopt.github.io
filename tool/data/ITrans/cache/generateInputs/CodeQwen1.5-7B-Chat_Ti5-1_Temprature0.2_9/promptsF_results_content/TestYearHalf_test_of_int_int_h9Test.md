## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`test2`) is that the `year` and `half` values used to create `test2` are the same as the `year` and `half` values used to create `test`. 

## Explanation
In the original test case, `test` is created using the `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method, and `test2` is created using the same method with the same `year` and `half` values. The assertions in the test case verify that the `year` and `half` values of `test` and `test2` are equal.

To generate the follow-up input for each new source input, we can simply use the same `year` and `half` values to create the follow-up input `test2`.

## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = Year.MAX_VALUE;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2023;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

In each new input pair, the `test2` object is created using the same `year` and `half` values as the corresponding source input. This ensures that the `test2` object will have the same `year` and `half` values as the `test` object, satisfying the inferred relation.
