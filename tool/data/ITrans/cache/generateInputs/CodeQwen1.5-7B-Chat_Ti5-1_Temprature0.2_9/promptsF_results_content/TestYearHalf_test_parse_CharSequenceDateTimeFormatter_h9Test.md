## New input pair0:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2020";
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the method under test is that the `text` and `f` parameters are used to parse a `YearHalf` object. The `YearHalf` object is then compared to a new `YearHalf` object created using the `of` method with the parsed year and half. The `of` method takes a year and half as parameters and returns a `YearHalf` object. The `parse` method takes a `CharSequence` and a `DateTimeFormatter` as parameters and returns a `YearHalf` object. The `YearHalf` class has a `from` method that takes a `TemporalAccessor` as a parameter and returns a `YearHalf` object. The `TemporalAccessor` returned by the `parse` method is passed to the `from` method to create a new `YearHalf` object.

## New input pair1:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H1 1999";
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
