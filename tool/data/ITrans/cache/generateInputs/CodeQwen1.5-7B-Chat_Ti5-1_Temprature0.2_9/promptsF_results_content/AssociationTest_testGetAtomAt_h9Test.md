# New input pair0:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 1;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, n);
    int position2 = 1;
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    association.setAtomAt(n, position);
    Association association2 = new Association(c, n);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that when an Atom is set at a specific position in an Association, the Atom at that position in the new Association should be the same. In this case, we set an Atom at position 1 in the original Association, and then created a new Association with the same Atom at position 1.

# New input pair1:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = -1;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, o);
    int position2 = 0;
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    association.setAtomAt(n, position);
    Association association2 = new Association(c, n);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that when an Atom is set at a specific position in an Association, the Atom at that position in the new Association should be the same. In this case, we set an Atom at position -1 in the original Association, which is not a valid position, so the Atom at position 0 in the new Association should be the same as the original Atom at position 0.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 2;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, o);
    int position2 = 0;
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    association.setAtomAt(n, position);
    Association association2 = new Association(c, n);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that when an Atom is set at a specific position in an Association, the Atom at that position in the new Association should be the same. In this case, we set an Atom at position 2 in the original Association, which is not a valid position, so the Atom at position 0 in the new Association should be the same as the original Atom at position 0.

# New input pair3:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 0;
    Association association2 = new Association(n, o);
    int position2 = 0;
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    association.setAtomAt(n, position);
    Association association2 = new Association(n, o);
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that when an Atom is set at a specific position in an Association, the Atom at that position in the new Association should be the same. In this case, we set an Atom at position 0 in the original Association, and then created a new Association with the same Atom at position 0.
