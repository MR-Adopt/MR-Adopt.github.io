## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String newSql = sql.replace(" ", "");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the original SQL statement should be normalized by removing all spaces. The new SQL statement is generated by removing all spaces from the original SQL statement.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3)";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String newSql = sql + ";";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the original SQL statement should be normalized by appending a semicolon at the end if it is missing. The new SQL statement is generated by appending a semicolon at the end of the original SQL statement.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3) ;";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String newSql = sql.replace(";", "");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the original SQL statement should be normalized by removing any semicolon at the end. The new SQL statement is generated by removing any semicolon at the end of the original SQL statement.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3)  ;";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String newSql = sql.replace(";", "");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the original SQL statement should be normalized by removing any semicolon at the end. The new SQL statement is generated by removing any semicolon at the end of the original SQL statement.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3)   ;";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String newSql = sql.replace(";", "");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the original SQL statement should be normalized by removing any semicolon at the end. The new SQL statement is generated by removing any semicolon at the end of the original SQL statement.
