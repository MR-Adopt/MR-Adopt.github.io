## New input pair0:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    // Since the fieldName is set to an empty string, the hashCode will be 0.
    // Since the fullClassName is set to the same value, the hashCode will also be 0.
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if and only if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. In this case, since both the fieldName and fullClassName are set to empty strings, their hashCodes will also be 0, satisfying the relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("");
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    // Since the fieldName is set to the same value, the hashCode will be the same.
    // Since the fullClassName is set to an empty string, the hashCode will be 0.
    // Since the hashCodes are the same, the two SerializeSkipInfo objects will be considered equal.
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if and only if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. In this case, since both the fieldName and fullClassName are set to the same value, their hashCodes will also be the same, satisfying the relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName1,testFullClassName2");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName1,testFullClassName2");
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    // Since the fieldName is set to the same value, the hashCode will be the same.
    // Since the fullClassName is set to the same value, the hashCode will also be the same.
    // Since the hashCodes are the same, the two SerializeSkipInfo objects will be considered equal.
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if and only if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. In this case, since both the fieldName and fullClassName are set to the same value, their hashCodes will also be the same, satisfying the relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName1,testFullClassName2,testFullClassName3");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName1,testFullClassName2,testFullClassName3");
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    // Since the fieldName is set to the same value, the hashCode will be the same.
    // Since the fullClassName is set to the same value, the hashCode will also be the same.
    // Since the hashCodes are the same, the two SerializeSkipInfo objects will be considered equal.
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if and only if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. In this case, since both the fieldName and fullClassName are set to the same value, their hashCodes will also be the same, satisfying the relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName1,testFullClassName2,testFullClassName3,testFullClassName4");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName1,testFullClassName2,testFullClassName3,testFullClassName4");
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    // Since the fieldName is set to the same value, the hashCode will be the same.
    // Since the fullClassName is set to the same value, the hashCode will also be the same.
    // Since the hashCodes are the same, the two SerializeSkipInfo objects will be considered equal.
```

In this case, since both the fieldName and fullClassName are set to the same value, their hashCodes will also be the same, satisfying the relation.
