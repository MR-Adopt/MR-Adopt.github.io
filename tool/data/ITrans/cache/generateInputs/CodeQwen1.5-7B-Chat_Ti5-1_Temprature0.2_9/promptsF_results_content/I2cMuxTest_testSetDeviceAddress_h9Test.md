## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Inferred relation: The inferred relation is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class sets the device address of the i2cMux device and the `getDeviceAddress` method returns the device address. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we need to set the device address of `i2cMux` to a new value and then verify that the `getDeviceAddress` method returns the same value.
