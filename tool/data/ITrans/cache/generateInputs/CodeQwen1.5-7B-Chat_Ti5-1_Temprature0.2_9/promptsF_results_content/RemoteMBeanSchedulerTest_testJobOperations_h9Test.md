## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `job2Detail.getKey()` should return the same `JobKey` as `job22`. This is because the `JobKey` is part of the `JobDetail` object and is used to uniquely identify the job in the scheduler.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).build();
    JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `job2Detail.getKey()` should return the same `JobKey` as `job22`. This is because the `JobKey` is part of the `JobDetail` object and is used to uniquely identify the job in the scheduler.

## New input pair2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("This is a durable job").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("This is a durable job").build();
    JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `job2Detail.getKey()` should return the same `JobKey` as `job22`. This is because the `JobKey` is part of the `JobDetail` object and is used to uniquely identify the job in the scheduler.

## New input pair3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withJobData(new JobDataMap()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withJobData(new JobDataMap()).build();
    JobKey job22 = job2Detail.getKey();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `job2Detail.getKey()` should return the same `JobKey` as `job22`. This is because the `JobKey` is part of the `JobDetail` object and is used to uniquely identify the job in the scheduler.

## New input pair4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTriggers(newTrigger().withIdentity("trigger1", "group1").startNow().build()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTriggers(newTrigger().withIdentity("trigger1", "group1").startNow().build()).build();
