## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account1";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account1";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be the same for both `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2`. Since `retryCount1` is 3, the `retryCount2` should also be 3 to satisfy the relation. Similarly, since `ACCOUNT1` is "account1", the `ACCOUNT2` should also be "account1".

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account2";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account2";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account2";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be the same for both `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2`. Since `retryCount1` is 0, the `retryCount2` should also be 0 to satisfy the relation. Similarly, since `ACCOUNT1` is "account2", the `ACCOUNT2` should also be "account2".

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account3";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account3";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account3";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be the same for both `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2`. Since `retryCount1` is null, the `retryCount2` should also be null to satisfy the relation. Similarly, since `ACCOUNT1` is "account3", the `ACCOUNT2` should also be "account3".

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account4";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account4";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account4";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be the same for both `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2`. Since `retryCount1` is 5, the `retryCount2` should also be 5 to satisfy the relation. Similarly, since `ACCOUNT1` is "account4", the `ACCOUNT2` should also be "account4".

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account5";
    Integer retryCount2 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account5";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account5";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be the same for both `blobServiceClient` and `blobServiceClient2`. Since `retryCount1` is equal to the maximum number of retries specified in the `config`, the `retryCount2` should also be equal to the maximum number of retries to satisfy the relation. Similarly, since `ACCOUNT1` is "account5", the `ACCOUNT2` should also be "account5".
