## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects with the same skin URL and then compares their hash codes.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects with the same skin URL and then compares their hash codes.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects with the same skin and cape URLs and then compares their hash codes.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates two `PlayerTexturesMock` objects with the same skin URL and then compares their hash codes.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
