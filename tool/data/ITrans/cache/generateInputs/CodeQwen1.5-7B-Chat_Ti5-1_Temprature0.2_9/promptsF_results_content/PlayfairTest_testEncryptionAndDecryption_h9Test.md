## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLO";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the encrypted text.
To generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can call the 'encrypt' method of the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' with the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the plaintext.
The code used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is:
```java
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
This code satisfies the inferred relation because it is the encrypted text generated by the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' using the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the plaintext.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVA";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the encrypted text.

This code satisfies the inferred relation because it is the encrypted text generated by the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' using the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the plaintext.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ABCDE");
    String plaintext = "FGHIJ";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the encrypted text.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "12345";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the encrypted text.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "SPACE";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
