## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` is the result of calling `ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable)`, where `closeable` is a lambda expression that does nothing when closed. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it uses the same `closeable` object as the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` is the result of calling `ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable)`, where `closeable` is a custom `Closeable` object that throws an `IOException` when closed. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it uses the same `closeable` object as the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
