## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
    YearHalf test = YearHalf.from(LocalDate.of(year, 1, 1));
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year, expected), test);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the output of the `from` method is equal to the output of the `of` method when given the same year and expected half-of-year. In this case, the `from` method is called with a `LocalDate` object created from the year, month, and day values. The `of` method is then called with the same year and expected half-of-year values. The assertions in the original test case check that the two outputs are equal.
