## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getHalf().getValue();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)` should return a `YearHalf` object with the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `year1` and `half1` are the same as in the original test case, and `year2` is different, the resulting `YearHalf` object should have the same year and half as `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)`. Therefore, the follow-up input `year3` and `half3` should be the same as `year1` and `half1`, respectively.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 3;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getHalf().getValue();
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getHalf().getValue();

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2100;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getHalf().getValue();

    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
