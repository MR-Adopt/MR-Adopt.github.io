# REQUIRED DELIVERABLE
## New input pair0:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(1, 2);
    map.put(2, 3);
    map.put(3, 4);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `keySet()` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` should return the same set of keys as the `keySet()` method of the `anotherMap`. Since `anotherMap` has keys `1, 2, 3`, the `keySet()` method of `map` should also return these keys.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(6, 3);
    anotherMap.put(7, 7);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(5, 10);
    map.put(6, 3);
    map.put(7, 7);
```

## New input pair2:

    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(8, 1);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(5, 10);
    map.put(4, 3);
    map.put(3, 7);
    map.put(8, 1);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `keySet()` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` should return the same set of keys as the `keySet()` method of the `anotherMap`. Since `anotherMap` has keys `5, 4, 3, 8`, the `keySet()` method of `map` should also return these keys.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);

```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `keySet()` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` should return the same set of keys as the `keySet()` method of the `anotherMap`. Since `anotherMap` has keys `5, 4, 3, 5`, the `keySet()` method of `map` should also return these keys.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(null, 1);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(5, 10);
    map.put(4, 3);
    map.put(3, 7);
    map.put(null, 1);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `keySet()` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` should return the same set of keys as the `keySet()` method of the `anotherMap`. Since `anotherMap` has keys `5, 4, 3, null`, the `keySet()` method of `map` should also return these keys.
