# New input pair0:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(5, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(5);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
        transformer.transform(input, DiscreteFourierTransform.DEFAULT, (PhysicalStore<ComplexNumber>) transformed2);
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same structure as the original test case. The `transformer` and `input` are the same as in the original test case, and the only difference is the `transformed2` variable. The `transformer.transform` method is called with the same parameters as in the original test case, except for the `transformed2` variable, which is now used to store the result of the transformation.
