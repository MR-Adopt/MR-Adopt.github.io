## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```

## Explanation of new input pairs:
- New input pair0: The relation inferred from the original test case is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with different `retryCount` should not be equal. Since `retryCount` is used as a key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map, if two clients are created with the same `storageAccount` and different `retryCount`, they will be stored in different entries in the map. Therefore, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with `retryCount1 = 0` and `retryCount2 = 0` should not be equal.
- New input pair1: The relation inferred from the original test case is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with different `retryCount` should not be equal. Since `retryCount` is used as a key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map, if two clients are created with the same `storageAccount` and different `retryCount`, they will be stored in different entries in the map. Therefore, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with `retryCount1 = 3` and `retryCount2 = 3` should not be equal.
- New input pair2: The relation inferred from the original test case is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with different `retryCount` should not be equal. Since `retryCount` is used as a key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map, if two clients are created with the same `storageAccount` and different `retryCount`, they will be stored in different entries in the map. Therefore, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with `retryCount1 = 5` and `retryCount2 = 5` should not be equal.
- New input pair3: The relation inferred from the original test case is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with different `retryCount` should not be equal. Since `retryCount` is used as a key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map, if two clients are created with the same `storageAccount` and different `retryCount`, they will be stored in different entries in the map. Therefore, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with `retryCount1 = 10` and `retryCount2 = 10` should not be equal.
- New input pair4: The relation inferred from the original test case is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with different `retryCount` should not be equal. Since `retryCount` is used as a key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map, if two clients are created with the same `storageAccount` and different `retryCount`, they will be stored in different entries in the map. Therefore, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with `retryCount1 = null` and `retryCount2 = null` should not be equal.
