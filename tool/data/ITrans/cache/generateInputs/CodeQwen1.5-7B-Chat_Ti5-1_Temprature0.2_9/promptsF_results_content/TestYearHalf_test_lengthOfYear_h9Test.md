## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 2);
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 1);
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 2);
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1600;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1600, 1);
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2100, 2);
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 2);
```
Explanation: For the new source input pair0, the inferred relation is that the length of the year should be 366 if the year is a leap year, and 365 otherwise. Since 2020 is a leap year, the length of the year is 366. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is `YearHalf.of(2020, 2)`.

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 1);
```
Explanation: For the new source input pair1, the inferred relation is that the length of the year should be 366 if the year is a leap year, and 365 otherwise. Since 1900 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is `YearHalf.of(1900, 1)`.

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 2);
```
Explanation: For the new source input pair2, the inferred relation is that the length of the year should be 366 if the year is a leap year, and 365 otherwise. Since 2000 is a leap year, the length of the year is 366. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is `YearHalf.of(2000, 2)`.

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1600;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1600, 1);
```
Explanation: For the new source input pair3, the inferred relation is that the length of the year should be 366 if the year is a leap year, and 365 otherwise. Since 1600 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is `YearHalf.of(1600, 1)`.

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2100, 2);
```
Explanation: For the new source input pair4, the inferred relation is that the length of the year should be 366 if the year is a leap year, and 365 otherwise. Since 2100 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is `YearHalf.of(2100, 2)`.
