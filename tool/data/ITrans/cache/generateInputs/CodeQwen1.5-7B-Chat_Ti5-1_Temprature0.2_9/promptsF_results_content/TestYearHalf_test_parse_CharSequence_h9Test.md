## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. Therefore, to generate the follow-up input, we can use the `toString()` method of the YearHalf object to obtain the text representation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H2";
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. Therefore, to generate the follow-up input, we can use the `toString()` method of the YearHalf object to obtain the text representation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2021-H1";
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. Therefore, to generate the follow-up input, we can use the `toString()` method of the YearHalf object to obtain the text representation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2021-H2";
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. Therefore, to generate the follow-up input, we can use the `toString()` method of the YearHalf object to obtain the text representation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H1";
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. Therefore, to generate the follow-up input, we can use the `toString()` method of the YearHalf object to obtain the text representation.
