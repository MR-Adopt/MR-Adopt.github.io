# New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text is in the format "YYYY-hX", where YYYY is the year and X is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 2020 and a half-of-year of 2, which corresponds to the text "2020-h2".

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h1";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text is in the format "YYYY-hX", where YYYY is the year and X is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 1900 and a half-of-year of 1, which corresponds to the text "1900-h1".

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text is in the format "YYYY-hX", where YYYY is the year and X is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 2000 and a half-of-year of 2, which corresponds to the text "2000-h2".

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1800-h1";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1800-h1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text is in the format "YYYY-hX", where YYYY is the year and X is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 1800 and a half-of-year of 1, which corresponds to the text "1800-h1".

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2100-h2";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2100-h2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text is in the format "YYYY-hX", where YYYY is the year and X is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 2100 and a half-of-year of 2, which corresponds to the text "2100-h2".
