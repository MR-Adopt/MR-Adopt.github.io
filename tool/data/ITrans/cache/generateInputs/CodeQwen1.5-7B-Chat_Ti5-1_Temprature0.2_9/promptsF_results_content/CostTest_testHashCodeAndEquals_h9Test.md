## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the hash codes of two Cost objects with the same value should be equal. Since the hash code of a Cost object is based on its value, if the value of the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the same as the value of the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', their hash codes should also be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the hash codes of two Cost objects with the same value should be equal. Since the hash code of a Cost object is based on its value, if the value of the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the same as the value of the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', their hash codes should also be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the hash codes of two Cost objects with the same value should be equal. Since the hash code of a Cost object is based on its value, if the value of the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the same as the value of the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', their hash codes should also be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the hash codes of two Cost objects with the same value should be equal. Since the hash code of a Cost object is based on its value, if the value of the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the same as the value of the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', their hash codes should also be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the hash codes of two Cost objects with the same value should be equal. Since the hash code of a Cost object is based on its value, if the value of the 'SOURCE INPUT' is the same as the value of the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', their hash codes should also be the same.
