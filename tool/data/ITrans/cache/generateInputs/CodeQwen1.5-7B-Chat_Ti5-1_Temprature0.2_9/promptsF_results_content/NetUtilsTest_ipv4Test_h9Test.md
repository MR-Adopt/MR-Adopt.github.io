## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.1.1";
    long ipLong2 = 3232235777L;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 address when it is converted back to a string using the `longToIpv4` method. Since the original test case compares the original IPv4 address with the converted IPv4 address, the inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the original IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the converted IPv4 address.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 167772161L;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 address when it is converted back to a string using the `longToIpv4` method. Since the original test case compares the original IPv4 address with the converted IPv4 address, the inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the original IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the converted IPv4 address.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 2886723073L;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 address when it is converted back to a string using the `longToIpv4` method. Since the original test case compares the original IPv4 address with the converted IPv4 address, the inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the original IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the converted IPv4 address.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "8.8.8.8";
    long ipLong2 = 134744072L;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 address when it is converted back to a string using the `longToIpv4` method. Since the original test case compares the original IPv4 address with the converted IPv4 address, the inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the original IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the converted IPv4 address.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "255.255.255.255";
    long ipLong2 = 4294967295L;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 address when it is converted back to a string using the `longToIpv4` method. Since the original test case compares the original IPv4 address with the converted IPv4 address, the inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the original IPv4 address is equal to the long value obtained from the converted IPv4 address.
