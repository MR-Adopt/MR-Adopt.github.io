## New input pair0:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "Hello World".getBytes();
    String input2 = Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encoded string is derived from the original byte array. The encoded string is obtained by calling the `encode` method of the `Base64` class with the original byte array as the input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "1234567890".getBytes();
    String input2 = Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encoded string is derived from the original byte array. The encoded string is obtained by calling the `encode` method of the `Base64` class with the original byte array as the input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "!@#$%^&*()".getBytes();
    String input2 = Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encoded string is derived from the original byte array. The encoded string is obtained by calling the `encode` method of the `Base64` class with the original byte array as the input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "".getBytes();
    String input2 = Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encoded string is derived from the original byte array. The encoded string is obtained by calling the `encode` method of the `Base64` class with the original byte array as the input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "a".getBytes();
    String input2 = Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encoded string is derived from the original byte array. The encoded string is obtained by calling the `encode` method of the `Base64` class with the original byte array as the input.
