## New input pair0:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Generation code:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be decrypted to the same value as the source input. Since the source input is 0L, the encrypted value will also be 0L. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Generation code:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    String message = encrypt(value);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be decrypted to the same value as the source input. Since the source input is Long.MAX_VALUE, the encrypted value will also be Long.MAX_VALUE. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Generation code:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
    String message = encrypt(value);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be decrypted to the same value as the source input. Since the source input is -1L, the encrypted value will also be -1L. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Generation code:
```java
    Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
    String message = encrypt(value);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be decrypted to the same value as the source input. Since the source input is Long.MIN_VALUE, the encrypted value will also be Long.MIN_VALUE. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Long value = null;
    String message = encrypt(value);
    Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Generation code:
```java
    Long value = null;
    String message = encrypt(value);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the encrypted value of the source input should be decrypted to the same value as the source input. Since the source input is null, the encrypted value will also be null. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.
