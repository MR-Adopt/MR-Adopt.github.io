## New input pair0:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should be created with the same pool size. Since the pool size is 0, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` will create a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when acquiring pooled resources.

## New input pair1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should be created with the same pool size. Since the pool size is 1, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` will create a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when acquiring pooled resources.

## New input pair2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should be created with the same pool size. Since the pool size is 10, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` will create a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when acquiring pooled resources.

## New input pair3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should be created with the same pool size. Since the pool size is 100, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` will create a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when acquiring pooled resources.

## New input pair4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should be created with the same pool size. Since the pool size is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` will create a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when acquiring pooled resources.
