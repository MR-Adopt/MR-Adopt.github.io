## New input pair0:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0-alpha1";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-alpha1";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `valueOf` should be equal to the input string. Therefore, when the input string is "1.0.0-alpha1", the output should also be "1.0.0-alpha1".

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v = "2.0";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `valueOf` should be equal to the input string. Therefore, when the input string is "2.0", the output should also be "2.0".

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v = "0.1.1";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "0.1.1";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `valueOf` should be equal to the input string. Therefore, when the input string is "0.1.1", the output should also be "0.1.1".

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v = "3.0.0-beta2";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "3.0.0-beta2";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `valueOf` should be equal to the input string. Therefore, when the input string is "3.0.0-beta2", the output should also be "3.0.0-beta2".

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v = "4.0";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "4.0";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `valueOf` should be equal to the input string. Therefore, when the input string is "4.0", the output should also be "4.0".
