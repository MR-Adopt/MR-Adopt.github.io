# New input pair1:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new RandomUuidGenerator();
UuidGenerator generator2 = new RandomUuidGenerator();
UUID uuid1 = generator.generateId();
UUID uuid2 = generator2.generateId();
assertNotEquals(uuid1, uuid2);
```

## Explanation:
In the original test case, the `generateId()` method of the `RandomUuidGenerator` class is called twice to generate two unique UUIDs. The `assertNotEquals()` method is used to verify that the two UUIDs are not equal, ensuring that the program under test is generating different non-null UUIDs.

To satisfy the inferred relation, we can create a new test case with the same method under test but with different source inputs. In this case, we create two new instances of `RandomUuidGenerator` and call the `generateId()` method on each instance to generate two unique UUIDs. We then use the `assertNotEquals()` method to verify that the two UUIDs are not equal.

# New input pair2:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new RandomUuidGenerator();
UuidGenerator generator2 = new RandomUuidGenerator();
UUID uuid1 = generator.generateId();
UUID uuid2 = generator2.generateId();
assertNotEquals(uuid1, uuid2);
```
