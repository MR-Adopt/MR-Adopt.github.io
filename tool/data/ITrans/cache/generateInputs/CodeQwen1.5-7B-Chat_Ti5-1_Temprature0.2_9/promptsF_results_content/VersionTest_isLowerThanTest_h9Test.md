## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A2";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. In this case, `v1` is "1.0-A1" and `v2` is "1.0-A2". Since "1.0-A1" is a lower version than "1.0-A2", the follow-up input is "1.0-A2".

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.1";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. In this case, `v1` is "1.1.0" and `v2` is "1.1.1". Since "1.1.0" is a lower version than "1.1.1", the follow-up input is "1.1.1".

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A2";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. In this case, `v1` is "1.1.0-A1" and `v2` is "1.1.0-A2". Since "1.1.0-A1" is a lower version than "1.1.0-A2", the follow-up input is "1.1.0-A2".

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. In this case, `v1` is "1.0.0" and `v2` is "1.0.1". Since "1.0.0" is a lower version than "1.0.1", the follow-up input is "1.0.1".

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1";
    String v2 = "2";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1";
    String v2 = "2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. In this case, `v1` is "1" and `v2` is "2". Since "1" is a lower version than "2", the follow-up input is "2".
