# New input pair1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor1 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test1", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support1 = new TestSupport(executor1.getThreadPoolId(), executor1, manager);
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor1 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test1", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support1 = new TestSupport(executor1.getThreadPoolId(), executor1, manager);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `getThreadPoolId()` method of the `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` class returns the same thread-pool id as the `getThreadPoolId()` method of the `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` class. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to create a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread-pool id and use it to create a new `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` instance.

# New input pair2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor2 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test2", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support2 = new TestSupport(executor2.getThreadPoolId(), executor2, manager);
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor2 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test2", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support2 = new TestSupport(executor2.getThreadPoolId(), executor2, manager);
```
