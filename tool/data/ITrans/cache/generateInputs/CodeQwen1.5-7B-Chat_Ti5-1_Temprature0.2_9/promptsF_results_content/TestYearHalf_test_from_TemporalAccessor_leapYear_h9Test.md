## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the value of `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object. Since the year is incremented by 1, the value of `expected` is also incremented by 1. Therefore, for a new source input where the year is 2009, the value of `expected` should also be 2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2010;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    int year = 2010;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the value of `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object. Since the year is incremented by 1, the value of `expected` is also incremented by 1. Therefore, for a new source input where the year is 2010, the value of `expected` should also be 3.
