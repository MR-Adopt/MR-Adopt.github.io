## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2).getHalf().getValue();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `withHalf` method of the `YearHalf` class returns a new `YearHalf` object with the specified half-of-year. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to call the `withHalf` method on a `YearHalf` object with the specified `year1` and `half1`, and then extract the year and half-of-year from the resulting `YearHalf` object. The `year3` and `half3` values are the extracted year and half-of-year, respectively.
