## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `setDeviceBus` method of the `I2cMux` class sets the I2C bus for the device, and the `getDeviceBus` method retrieves the current I2C bus. Since the original test case sets the I2C bus to "1" and then checks that the retrieved bus matches the set bus, the new input pair sets the I2C bus to "0" and checks that the retrieved bus matches the set bus.

## New input pair1:

    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
