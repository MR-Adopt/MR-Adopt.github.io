## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least one entry, which is a requirement for the test case to be valid.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", 789L);
    v01.put("101112", 101112L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the map, where the keys are "789" and "101112" respectively, and the values are 789L and 101112L respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least two entries, which is a requirement for the test case to be valid.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("131415", 131415L);
    v01.put("161718", 161718L);
    v01.put("192021", 192021L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds three new key-value pairs to the map, where the keys are "131415", "161718", and "192021" respectively, and the values are 131415L, 161718L, and 192021L respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least three entries, which is a requirement for the test case to be valid.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("232425", 232425L);
    v01.put("262728", 262728L);
    v01.put("292930", 292930L);
    v01.put("313233", 313233L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds four new key-value pairs to the map, where the keys are "232425", "262728", "292930", and "313233" respectively, and the values are 232425L, 262728L, 292930L, and 313233L respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least four entries, which is a requirement for the test case to be valid.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("343536", 343536L);
    v01.put("363738", 363738L);
    v01.put("383940", 383940L);
    v01.put("404142", 404142L);
    v01.put("424344", 424344L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds five new key-value pairs to the map, where the keys are "343536", "363738", "383940", "404142", and "424344" respectively, and the values are 343536L, 363738L, 383940L, 404142L, and 424344L respectively. This ensures that the map contains at least five entries, which is a requirement for the test case to be valid.
