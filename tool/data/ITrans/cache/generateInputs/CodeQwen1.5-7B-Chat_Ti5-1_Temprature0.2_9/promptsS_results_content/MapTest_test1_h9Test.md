## New input1:
```java
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("12x", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it maintains the same key-value pairs as the original test case. It is a simple and basic test case that covers the basic functionality of the program under test.

## New input2:
```java
    v01.put("empty", "");
    v01.put("null", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the original test case. The key "empty" has an empty string as its value, and the key "null" has a null value. This covers a range of possible inputs, including edge cases.

## New input3:
```java
    v01.put("largeKey", 12345678901234567890L);
    v01.put("smallKey", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the original test case. The key "largeKey" has a long value that is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in an integer, while the key "smallKey" has an integer value. This covers a range of possible inputs, including large and small values.

## New input4:
```java
    v01.put("negativeKey", -123);
    v01.put("positiveKey", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the original test case. The key "negativeKey" has a negative integer value, while the key "positiveKey" has a positive integer value. This covers a range of possible inputs, including negative and positive values.

## New input5:
```java
    v01.put("specialKey", "@#$%^&*()");
    v01.put("normalKey", "123");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the original test case. The key "specialKey" has a string value that contains special characters, while the key "normalKey" has a string value that contains only digits. This covers a range of possible inputs, including special characters and normal strings.
