## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is less than the minimum value of 20,000 specified in the original test case. This ensures that the method under test is tested with a lower value, which may help identify any potential issues related to handling lower values.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 30_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is greater than the maximum value of 20,000 specified in the original test case. This ensures that the method under test is tested with a higher value, which may help identify any potential issues related to handling higher values.

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 15_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is in the middle range of the valid values specified in the original test case. This ensures that the method under test is tested with a value that falls within the expected range, which may help identify any potential issues related to handling values within the expected range.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 25_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is slightly above the minimum value of 20,000 specified in the original test case. This ensures that the method under test is tested with a slightly higher value, which may help identify any potential issues related to handling slightly higher values.

## New input5:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 35_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is slightly below the maximum value of 20,000 specified in the original test case. This ensures that the method under test is tested with a slightly lower value, which may help identify any potential issues related to handling slightly lower values.
