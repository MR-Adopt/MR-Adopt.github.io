## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is the original test case provided. It tests the method under test with a specific SQL statement.

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3)";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it removes the trailing semicolon from the original SQL statement. The method under test should still be able to handle the SQL statement without the semicolon.

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3) ;";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds an extra semicolon at the end of the original SQL statement. The method under test should still be able to handle the SQL statement with an extra semicolon.

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3)  ;";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds extra spaces after the semicolon in the original SQL statement. The method under test should still be able to handle the SQL statement with extra spaces.

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3)   ;";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds extra spaces and a semicolon at the end of the original SQL statement. The method under test should still be able to handle the SQL statement with extra spaces and a semicolon.
