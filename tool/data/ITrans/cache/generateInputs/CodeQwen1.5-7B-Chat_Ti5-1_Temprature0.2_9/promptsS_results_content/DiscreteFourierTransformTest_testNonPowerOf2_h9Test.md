## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(5, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 5x1 matrix with random double values between -2 and 4. The dimension of the matrix is a prime number, which is a requirement for the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(10, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(10);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 10x1 matrix with random double values between -2 and 4. The dimension of the matrix is a prime number, which is a requirement for the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(15, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(15);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 15x1 matrix with random double values between -2 and 4. The dimension of the matrix is a prime number, which is a requirement for the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(20, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(20);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 20x1 matrix with random double values between -2 and 4. The dimension of the matrix is a prime number, which is a requirement for the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(25, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(25);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 25x1 matrix with random double values between -2 and 4. The dimension of the matrix is a prime number, which is a requirement for the Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm.
