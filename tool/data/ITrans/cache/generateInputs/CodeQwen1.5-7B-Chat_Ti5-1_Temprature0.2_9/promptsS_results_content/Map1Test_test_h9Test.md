## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key "456" and the value "def" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", "ghi");
    v01.put("123", "jkl");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map and maintains the uniqueness of keys. The key "789" and the value "ghi" are both strings, and the key "123" and the value "jkl" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("", "");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map with an empty string as the key and the value. An empty string is a valid entry in a HashMap.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map with a null value. Null is a valid entry in a HashMap.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "abc");
    v01.put("123", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map and maintains the uniqueness of keys. The key "123" and the value "def" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.
