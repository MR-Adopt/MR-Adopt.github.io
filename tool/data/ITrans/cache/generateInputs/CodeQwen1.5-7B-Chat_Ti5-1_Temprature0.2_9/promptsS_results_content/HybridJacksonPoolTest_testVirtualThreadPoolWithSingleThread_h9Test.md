## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of 0, which means there will be no thread-local caching. This can be useful in scenarios where thread-local caching is not necessary or desired.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of 1, which means there will be a single thread-local cache. This can be useful in scenarios where there is a need for a single point of caching for all threads.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of 10, which means there will be 10 thread-local caches. This can be useful in scenarios where there is a need for multiple points of caching for all threads.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of 100, which means there will be 100 thread-local caches. This can be useful in scenarios where there is a need for a large number of points of caching for all threads.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` constructor allows for a pool size of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which means there will be the maximum number of thread-local caches possible. This can be useful in scenarios where there is a need for an unlimited number of points of caching for all threads.
