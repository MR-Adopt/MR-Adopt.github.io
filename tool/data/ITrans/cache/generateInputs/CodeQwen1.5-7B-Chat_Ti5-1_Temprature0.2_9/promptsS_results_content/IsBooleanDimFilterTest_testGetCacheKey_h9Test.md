## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the attribute name from "x" to "y". This change should not affect the functionality of the method under test, as the method does not rely on the attribute name.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the column type from STRING to INTEGER. This change should not affect the functionality of the method under test, as the method does not rely on the column type.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value from "hello" to "world". This change should not affect the functionality of the method under test, as the method does not rely on the value.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a filter context. This change should not affect the functionality of the method under test, as the method does not rely on the filter context.

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a filter context. This change should not affect the functionality of the method under test, as the method does not rely on the filter context.
