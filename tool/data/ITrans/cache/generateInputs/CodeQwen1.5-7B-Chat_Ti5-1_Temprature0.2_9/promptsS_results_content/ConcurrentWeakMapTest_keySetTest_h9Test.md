## New input1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains different key-value pairs than the original `anotherMap`. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a different set of keys, which is a requirement for the test case.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(6, 3);
    anotherMap.put(7, 7);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains additional key-value pairs than the original `anotherMap`. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a larger set of keys, which is a requirement for the test case.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(8, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains a new key-value pair that is not present in the original `anotherMap`. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set that includes a new key, which is a requirement for the test case.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(5, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains a key that is already present in the original `anotherMap`, but with a different value. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set that includes an existing key with a different value, which is a requirement for the test case.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(null, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains a null key, which is a valid input for the `putAll()` method. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set that includes a null key, which is a requirement for the test case.
