## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it maintains the original SQL statement format but removes unnecessary whitespace and extra parentheses. It ensures that the SQL statement is well-formed and follows the standard syntax.

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE;";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a semicolon at the end of the SQL statement. Adding a semicolon at the end of a SQL statement is optional in many SQL dialects, but it is a good practice to include it to indicate the end of the statement.

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE; ";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a space after the semicolon at the end of the SQL statement. Adding a space after the semicolon is not necessary, but it is a good practice to include it to maintain consistency in the SQL statement.

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE;  ";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two spaces after the semicolon at the end of the SQL statement. Adding extra spaces after the semicolon is not necessary, but it is a good practice to include it to maintain consistency in the SQL statement.

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE;   ";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds three spaces after the semicolon at the end of the SQL statement. Adding extra spaces after the semicolon is not necessary, but it is a good practice to include it to maintain consistency in the SQL statement.
