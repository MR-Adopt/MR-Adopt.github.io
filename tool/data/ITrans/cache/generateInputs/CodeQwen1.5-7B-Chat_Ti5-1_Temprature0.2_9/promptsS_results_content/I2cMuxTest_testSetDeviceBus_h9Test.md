## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: The valid range for the I2C bus is from "0" to "7". This input sets the I2C bus to the lowest possible value, which is "0".

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: The valid range for the I2C bus is from "0" to "7". This input sets the I2C bus to the highest possible value, which is "7".

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
```
Explanation: The valid range for the I2C bus is from "0" to "7". This input sets the I2C bus to a middle value, which is "3".

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "2";
```
Explanation: The valid range for the I2C bus is from "0" to "7". This input sets the I2C bus to a second middle value, which is "2".

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "5";
```
Explanation: The valid range for the I2C bus is from "0" to "7". This input sets the I2C bus to a third middle value, which is "5".
