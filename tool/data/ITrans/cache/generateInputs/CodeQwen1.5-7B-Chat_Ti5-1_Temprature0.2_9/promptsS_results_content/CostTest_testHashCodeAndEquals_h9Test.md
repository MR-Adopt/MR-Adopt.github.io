## New input1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `Cost` class has a constructor that takes an integer value representing the cost in seconds. The value `0` is a valid input for the `costOfSeconds` method, and it should produce a `Cost` object with a hash code of `0`.

## New input2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `Cost` class has a constructor that takes an integer value representing the cost in seconds. The value `Integer.MAX_VALUE` is the maximum possible value for an integer, and it should produce a `Cost` object with a hash code equal to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

## New input3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `Cost` class has a constructor that takes an integer value representing the cost in seconds. The value `-1` is a negative integer, and it should produce a `Cost` object with a hash code equal to `-1`.

## New input4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `Cost` class has a constructor that takes an integer value representing the cost in seconds. The value `100` is a valid input for the `costOfSeconds` method, and it should produce a `Cost` object with a hash code equal to `100`.

## New input5:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `Cost` class has a constructor that takes an integer value representing the cost in seconds. The value `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is the minimum possible value for an integer, and it should produce a `Cost` object with a hash code equal to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
