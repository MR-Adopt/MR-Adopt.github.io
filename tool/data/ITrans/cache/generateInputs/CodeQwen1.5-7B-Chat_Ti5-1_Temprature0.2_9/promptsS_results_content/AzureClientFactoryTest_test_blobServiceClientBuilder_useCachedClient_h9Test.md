## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account1";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a different value for `retryCount1` and `ACCOUNT1` compared to the original test case. It also uses a different storage account name, `account1`, which is different from the original `account`. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario and verifies that the `getBlobServiceClient` method returns a different client when the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` parameters are different.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account2";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a different value for `retryCount1` and `ACCOUNT1` compared to the original test case. It also uses a different storage account name, `account2`, which is different from the original `account`. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario and verifies that the `getBlobServiceClient` method returns a different client when the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` parameters are different.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account3";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a different value for `retryCount1` and `ACCOUNT1` compared to the original test case. It also uses a different storage account name, `account3`, which is different from the original `account`. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario and verifies that the `getBlobServiceClient` method returns a different client when the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` parameters are different.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account4";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a different value for `retryCount1` and `ACCOUNT1` compared to the original test case. It also uses a different storage account name, `account4`, which is different from the original `account`. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario and verifies that the `getBlobServiceClient` method returns a different client when the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` parameters are different.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = config.getMaxTries();
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account5";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it provides a different value for `retryCount1` and `ACCOUNT1` compared to the original test case. It also uses a different storage account name, `account5`, which is different from the original `account`. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario and verifies that the `getBlobServiceClient` method returns a different client when the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` parameters are different.
