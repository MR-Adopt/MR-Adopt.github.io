## New input1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Closeable` object that does nothing when closed. This is a common use case when testing code that deals with resources, as it allows the resource to be closed without any side effects.

## New input2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Closeable` object that throws an `IOException` when closed. This is a common use case when testing code that deals with resources, as it allows the resource to throw an exception when closed, which can be caught and handled appropriately.

## New input3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
```

## New input4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
```

## New input5:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // Do nothing
        }
    };
