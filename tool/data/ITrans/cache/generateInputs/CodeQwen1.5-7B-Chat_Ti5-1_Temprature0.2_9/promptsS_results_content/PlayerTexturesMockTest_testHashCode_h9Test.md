## New input1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets a different URL for the skin. The URL "https://github.com/skin1" is different from the original URL "https://github.com/skin", so the hashCode should be different.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the skin to null. Since the skin is null, the hashCode should be 0.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets a different URL for the cape. The URL "https://github.com/cape" is different from the original URL "https://github.com/skin", so the hashCode should be different.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the skin to the same URL twice. Since the skin is the same, the hashCode should be the same.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the skin and cape to the same URL twice. Since the skin and cape are the same, the hashCode should be the same.
