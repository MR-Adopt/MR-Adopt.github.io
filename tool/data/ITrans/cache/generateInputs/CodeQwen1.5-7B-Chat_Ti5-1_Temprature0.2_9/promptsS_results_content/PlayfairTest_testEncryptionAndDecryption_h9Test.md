## New input1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLO";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword (SECRET) and a different plaintext (HELLO) than the original test case. The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVA";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses the same keyword (KEYWORD) as the original test case but a different plaintext (JAVA). The plaintext is chosen to be different to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ABCDE");
    String plaintext = "FGHIJ";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword (ABCDE) and a different plaintext (FGHIJ) than the original test case. The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "12345";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses the same keyword (KEYWORD) as the original test case but a different plaintext (12345). The plaintext is chosen to be different to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "SPACE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses the same keyword (KEYWORD) as the original test case but a different plaintext (SPACE). The plaintext is chosen to be different to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are tested with different inputs.
