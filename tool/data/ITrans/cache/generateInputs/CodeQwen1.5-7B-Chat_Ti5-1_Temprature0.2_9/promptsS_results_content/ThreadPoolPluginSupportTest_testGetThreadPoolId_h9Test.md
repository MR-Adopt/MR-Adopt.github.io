## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor1 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test1", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool ID ("test1") and different core and maximum pool sizes (10), keep-alive time (2000L), time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), work queue (ArrayBlockingQueue with capacity 2), thread factory (Thread::new), and rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy). This input explores a valid scenario where the thread pool ID is different from the original one.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor2 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test2", manager, 0, 0, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool ID ("test2"), core and maximum pool sizes set to 0, keep-alive time set to 0L, time unit set to TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, work queue set to a LinkedBlockingQueue, thread factory set to Thread::new, and rejection handler set to ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy. This input explores a valid scenario where the thread pool is configured to have no threads, and the work queue is a LinkedBlockingQueue.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor3 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test3", manager, 5, 10, 500L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new PriorityBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool ID ("test3"), core and maximum pool sizes set to 5 and 10 respectively, keep-alive time set to 500L, time unit set to TimeUnit.SECONDS, work queue set to a PriorityBlockingQueue, thread factory set to Thread::new, and rejection handler set to ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy. This input explores a valid scenario where the work queue is a PriorityBlockingQueue, and the rejection handler is DiscardPolicy.

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor4 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test4", manager, 1, 1, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool ID ("test4"), core and maximum pool sizes set to 1, keep-alive time set to 1000L, time unit set to TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, work queue set to a SynchronousQueue, thread factory set to Thread::new, and rejection handler set to ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy. This input explores a valid scenario where the work queue is a SynchronousQueue, and the rejection handler is AbortPolicy.

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor5 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test5", manager, 3, 5, 3000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new DelayQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool ID ("test5"), core and maximum pool sizes set to 3 and 5 respectively, keep-alive time set to 3000L, time unit set to TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, work queue set to a DelayQueue, thread factory set to Thread::new, and rejection handler set to ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy. This input explores a valid scenario where the work queue is a DelayQueue, and the rejection handler is DiscardOldestPolicy.
