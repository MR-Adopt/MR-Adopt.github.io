## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`text`) is that the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` with "-H" and the `half` value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "-H1";
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` with "-H" and the `half` value. In this case, since the `year` is `Year.MIN_VALUE` and the `half` is `1`, the `text` becomes "-H1".

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2021-H2";
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` with "-H" and the `half` value. In this case, since the `year` is `2021` and the `half` is `2`, the `text` becomes "2021-H2".

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2000-H1";
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` with "-H" and the `half` value. In this case, since the `year` is `2000` and the `half` is `1`, the `text` becomes "2000-H1".

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year = 2025;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2025-H2";
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` with "-H" and the `half` value. In this case, since the `year` is `2025` and the `half` is `2`, the `text` becomes "2025-H2".

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year = Year.MAX_VALUE;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "-H1";
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` with "-H" and the `half` value. In this case, since the `year` is `Year.MAX_VALUE` and the `half` is `1`, the `text` becomes "-H1".
