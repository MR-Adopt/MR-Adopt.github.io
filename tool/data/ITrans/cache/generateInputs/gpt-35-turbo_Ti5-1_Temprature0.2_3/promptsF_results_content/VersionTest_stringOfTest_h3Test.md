## New input pair0:
```java
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf("1.0.0");
```

Explanation: 
The original test case asserts that `Version.stringOf(version1)` should return the same value as `v`. In this case, `v` is "1.0.0" and `version1` is created using `Version.valueOf(v)`. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can directly assign `version1` to `Version.valueOf("1.0.0")`. This ensures that `Version.stringOf(version1)` will return the same value as `v`.
