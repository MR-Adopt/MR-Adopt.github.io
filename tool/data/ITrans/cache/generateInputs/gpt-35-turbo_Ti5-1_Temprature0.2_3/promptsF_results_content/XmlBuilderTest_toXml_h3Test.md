## Inferred Relation
The `parse` method takes an XML string as input and converts it into a `XmlBuilder` object. The `toXml` method of the `XmlBuilder` class converts the `XmlBuilder` object back into an XML string.

The inferred relation between the source input (`XML`) and the follow-up input (`xmlBuilder2`) is that the `xmlBuilder2` object is created by parsing the XML string (`XML`) using the `parse` method. The `toXml` method is then called on the `xmlBuilder2` object to convert it back into an XML string.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";

XmlBuilder xmlBuilder = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
String followUpInput = xmlBuilder.toXml();
```

The follow-up input (`followUpInput`) is obtained by calling the `toXml` method on the `xmlBuilder` object created by parsing the XML string (`XML`). This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case, where the XML string is parsed to create an `XmlBuilder` object, and then the `toXml` method is called on the `XmlBuilder` object to obtain the XML string.

This new input pair should pass the assertion in the original test case.
