## Inferred Relation
The `hashCode()` method in the `AuditInfo` class uses the `Objects.hash()` method to calculate the hash code based on the values of the `author`, `identity`, `comment`, and `ip` fields. Therefore, two `AuditInfo` objects will have the same hash code if their corresponding fields have the same values.

## Explanation
Based on the inferred relation, we can generate the follow-up input by creating a new `AuditInfo` object with the same field values as the source input. Since the `hashCode()` method relies on the field values, the follow-up input will have the same hash code as the source input.

## New input pair 0:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo(null, "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo(null, "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
```
The follow-up input `auditInfo2` has the same field values as the source input `auditInfo1`. Both objects have a `null` value for the `author` field, "id" for the `identity` field, "test equality" for the `comment` field, and "127.0.0.1" for the `ip` field. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will have the same hash code as the source input.

## New input pair 1:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", null, "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", null, "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
```
The follow-up input `auditInfo2` has the same field values as the source input `auditInfo1`. Both objects have "druid" for the `author` field, a `null` value for the `identity` field, "test equality" for the `comment` field, and "127.0.0.1" for the `ip` field. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will have the same hash code as the source input.

## New input pair 2:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", null, "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", null, "127.0.0.1");
```
The follow-up input `auditInfo2` has the same field values as the source input `auditInfo1`. Both objects have "druid" for the `author` field, "id" for the `identity` field, a `null` value for the `comment` field, and "127.0.0.1" for the `ip` field. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will have the same hash code as the source input.

## New input pair 3:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", null);
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", null);
```
The follow-up input `auditInfo2` has the same field values as the source input `auditInfo1`. Both objects have "druid" for the `author` field, "id" for the `identity` field, "test equality" for the `comment` field, and a `null` value for the `ip` field. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will have the same hash code as the source input.

## New input pair 4:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("", "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("", "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
```
The follow-up input `auditInfo2` has the same field values as the source input `auditInfo1`. Both objects have an empty string for the `author` field, "id" for the `identity` field, "test equality" for the `comment` field, and "127.0.0.1" for the `ip` field. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will have the same hash code as the source input.
