## New input pair0:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 1);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field for calculating the hash code. In the original test case, `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` value, so their hash codes are expected to be equal. In this new input pair, `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` value ("group"), so their hash codes will be equal and the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 1);
```

Explanation: Similar to the previous new input pair, the inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field for calculating the hash code. In this new input pair, `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` value ("group"), so their hash codes will be equal and the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group1", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group1", 1, 1);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field for calculating the hash code. In this new input pair, `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` value ("group1"), so their hash codes will be equal and the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group2", 1, 1);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group2", 2, 2);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field for calculating the hash code. In this new input pair, `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` value ("group2"), so their hash codes will be equal and the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group3", 2, 2);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group3", 3, 3);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field for calculating the hash code. In this new input pair, `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` value ("group3"), so their hash codes will be equal and the assertion in the original test case will pass.
