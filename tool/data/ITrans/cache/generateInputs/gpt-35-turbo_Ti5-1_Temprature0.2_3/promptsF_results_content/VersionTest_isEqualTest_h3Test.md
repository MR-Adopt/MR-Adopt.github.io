## Inferred Relation
Based on the given test case and the code under test, the inferred relation between the source input (`v1`) and the follow-up input (`v2`) is as follows:

- The major version of `v1` should be equal to the major version of `v2`.
- The minor version of `v1` should be less than the minor version of `v2`.
- If the major and minor versions of `v1` are equal to the major and minor versions of `v2`, respectively, then the revision of `v1` should be less than the revision of `v2`.

## Explanation
The original test case checks if the `isEqual` method of the `Version` class returns `false` when comparing two versions (`a` and `b`). The versions are created using the `valueOf` method, which parses the input string and constructs a `Version` object.

The `valueOf` method splits the input string into major, minor, revision, and build parts. It then constructs a `Version` object using these parts. The major, minor, and revision parts are split further if they contain a letter followed by a number (e.g., "1.0-A1" or "1.1.0-A1").

To generate the follow-up input (`v2`) for a given source input (`v1`), we need to ensure that the major version of `v2` is the same as the major version of `v1`. We also need to ensure that the minor version of `v2` is greater than the minor version of `v1`. If the major and minor versions of `v1` are the same as the major and minor versions of `v2`, respectively, then the revision of `v2` should be greater than the revision of `v1`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.10";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation. The major version of `v1` is equal to the major version of `v2` (1). The minor version of `v1` (0) is less than the minor version of `v2` (10). Therefore, the follow-up input (`v2`) is constructed to satisfy these conditions.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation. The major version of `v1` is equal to the major version of `v2` (1). The minor version of `v1` (0) is less than the minor version of `v2` (1). Therefore, the follow-up input (`v2`) is constructed to satisfy these conditions.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation. The major version of `v1` is equal to the major version of `v2` (1). The minor version of `v1` (0) is less than the minor version of `v2` (1). Therefore, the follow-up input (`v2`) is constructed to satisfy these conditions.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "2.0";
```
This new input pair does not satisfy the inferred relation. The major version of `v1` is not equal to the major version of `v2` (1 != 2). Therefore, the follow-up input (`v2`) cannot be constructed to satisfy the conditions.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "2.0-A1";
```
This new input pair does not satisfy the inferred relation. The major version of `v1` is not equal to the major version of `v2` (1 != 2). Therefore, the follow-up input (`v2`) cannot be constructed to satisfy the conditions.
