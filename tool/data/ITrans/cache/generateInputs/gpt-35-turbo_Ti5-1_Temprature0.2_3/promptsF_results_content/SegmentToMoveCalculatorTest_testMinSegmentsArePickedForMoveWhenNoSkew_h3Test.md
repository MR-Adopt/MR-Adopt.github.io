## Inferred Relation:
Based on the code analysis, the inferred relation between the source inputs and the follow-up inputs can be summarized as follows:

1. The `totalSegmentsInTier` value is used to calculate the minimum number of segments to be considered for moving in a tier.
2. The `tier`, `historicals`, and `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` values are used to calculate the number of segments to be picked for moving in the given tier, based on the level of skew between the historicals in the tier.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 0, the minimum number of segments to move will be 0 as well. The `tier`, `historicals`, and `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` values can be set to any valid values as they are not directly related to the `totalSegmentsInTier` value.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 1, the minimum number of segments to move will be 1 as well. The `tier`, `historicals`, and `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` values can be set to any valid values as they are not directly related to the `totalSegmentsInTier` value.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 100,000. The minimum number of segments to move will be calculated based on this value. The `tier`, `historicals`, and `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` values can be set to any valid values as they are not directly related to the `totalSegmentsInTier` value.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 50_000;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 50,000. The minimum number of segments to move will be calculated based on this value. The `tier`, `historicals`, and `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` values can be set to any valid values as they are not directly related to the `totalSegmentsInTier` value.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to the maximum value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The minimum number of segments to move will be calculated based on this value. The `tier`, `historicals`, and `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` values can be set to any valid values as they are not directly related to the `totalSegmentsInTier` value.

The provided follow-up inputs for each new source input satisfy the inferred relation because they adhere to the requirements of the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` and `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` methods. The follow-up inputs ensure that the assertions in the original test case will pass.
