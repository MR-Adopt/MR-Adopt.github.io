## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input (`i2cMux`, `deviceAddress`) and the follow-up input (`i2cMux2`) is that when the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceAddress`, the `getDeviceAddress` method should return the same `deviceAddress` on `i2cMux2`.

## Explanation
The `setDeviceAddress` method sets the address of the `i2cMux` device by calling the `setAddress` method with the provided `address`. The `getDeviceAddress` method returns the address of the `i2cMux` device.

In the original test case, the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceAddress`. Then, the `getDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux2` and the returned address is compared with the `deviceAddress` to assert that they are equal.

To generate the follow-up input, we can use the same source input code and create a new `i2cMux2` object. Since the `setDeviceAddress` method sets the address of the `i2cMux` device, calling it on `i2cMux` with the same `deviceAddress` will ensure that the `getDeviceAddress` method on `i2cMux2` returns the same address.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x70";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```

In this new input pair, the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceAddress` "0x70". Then, the `getDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux2` and the returned address is compared with the `deviceAddress` "0x70" to assert that they are equal. This satisfies the inferred relation.
