## Inferred Relation
Based on the given original test case and the method under test, we can infer that the `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` and `half` inputs with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year = 2020;
int half = 2;
CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
Explanation: The `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` and `half` inputs with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year = 1999;
int half = 1;
CharSequence text = "1999-h1";
```
Explanation: The `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` and `half` inputs with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year = 2025;
int half = 2;
CharSequence text = "2025-h2";
```
Explanation: The `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` and `half` inputs with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year = 2000;
int half = 1;
CharSequence text = "2000-h1";
```
Explanation: The `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` and `half` inputs with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year = 2022;
int half = 2;
CharSequence text = "2022-h2";
```
Explanation: The `text` input is constructed by concatenating the `year` and `half` inputs with a hyphen in between.
