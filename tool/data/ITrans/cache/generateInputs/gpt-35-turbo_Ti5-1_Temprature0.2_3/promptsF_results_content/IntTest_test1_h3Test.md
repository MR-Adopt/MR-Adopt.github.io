## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `v01` and the follow-up input `str` is that `str` is the JSON string representation of `v01`. The `toJSONString` method takes an object and converts it into a JSON string.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    Integer v01 = 0;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String str = JSON.toJSONString(v01);
```
Explanation:
The follow-up input `str` will be equal to `"0"`, which is the JSON string representation of the integer value `0`. This satisfies the inferred relation as the JSON string representation of `v01` is `"0"`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    Integer v01 = -1001;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String str = JSON.toJSONString(v01);
```
Explanation:
The follow-up input `str` will be equal to `"-1001"`, which is the JSON string representation of the integer value `-1001`. This satisfies the inferred relation as the JSON string representation of `v01` is `"-1001"`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    Integer v01 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String str = JSON.toJSONString(v01);
```
Explanation:
The follow-up input `str` will be equal to `"2147483647"`, which is the JSON string representation of the maximum integer value `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This satisfies the inferred relation as the JSON string representation of `v01` is `"2147483647"`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    Integer v01 = null;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String str = JSON.toJSONString(v01);
```
Explanation:
The follow-up input `str` will be equal to `"null"`, which is the JSON string representation of a null value. This satisfies the inferred relation as the JSON string representation of `v01` is `"null"`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    Integer v01 = 999999999;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String str = JSON.toJSONString(v01);
```
Explanation:
The follow-up input `str` will be equal to `"999999999"`, which is the JSON string representation of the integer value `999999999`. This satisfies the inferred relation as the JSON string representation of `v01` is `"999999999"`.
