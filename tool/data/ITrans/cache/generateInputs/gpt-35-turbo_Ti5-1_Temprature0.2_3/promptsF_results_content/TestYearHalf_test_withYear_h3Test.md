## Inferred Relation
The `withYear` method of the `YearHalf` class is used to create a new `YearHalf` instance with a different year value while keeping the same half value. The method takes an integer `year` as input and returns a new `YearHalf` instance with the specified year.

## Inferred Relation Explanation
Based on the given test case, the `withYear` method is called on a `YearHalf` instance created using the `of` method. The `withYear` method is called with a different year value (`year2`) and the assertion checks if the returned `YearHalf` instance is equal to another `YearHalf` instance created using the `of` method with the same half value (`half1`) and the original year value (`year1`).

From this, we can infer that the `withYear` method replaces the year value of a `YearHalf` instance with the specified year value while keeping the same half value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2000;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2005;
int year3 = 2005;
int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));
```
Explanation:
In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2000 and `half1` is set to 1. The `year2` is set to 2005. The `year3` is set to 2005 and `half3` is set to 1. The follow-up input asserts that the `YearHalf` instance created using `year3` and `half3` is equal to the `YearHalf` instance created using `year1` and `half1` with the year replaced by `year2`. This satisfies the inferred relation as it tests if the `withYear` method correctly replaces the year value while keeping the same half value.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2021;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2022;
int year3 = 2022;
int half3 = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));
```
Explanation:
In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2021 and `half1` is set to 2. The `year2` is set to 2022. The `year3` is set to 2022 and `half3` is set to 2. The follow-up input asserts that the `YearHalf` instance created using `year3` and `half3` is equal to the `YearHalf` instance created using `year1` and `half1` with the year replaced by `year2`. This satisfies the inferred relation as it tests if the `withYear` method correctly replaces the year value while keeping the same half value.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 1999;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2000;
int year3 = 2000;
int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));
```
Explanation:
In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 1999 and `half1` is set to 1. The `year2` is set to 2000. The `year3` is set to 2000 and `half3` is set to 1. The follow-up input asserts that the `YearHalf` instance created using `year3` and `half3` is equal to the `YearHalf` instance created using `year1` and `half1` with the year replaced by `year2`. This satisfies the inferred relation as it tests if the `withYear` method correctly replaces the year value while keeping the same half value.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2022;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2023;
int year3 = 2023;
int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));
```
Explanation:
In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2022 and `half1` is set to 1. The `year2` is set to 2023. The `year3` is set to 2023 and `half3` is set to 1. The follow-up input asserts that the `YearHalf` instance created using `year3` and `half3` is equal to the `YearHalf` instance created using `year1` and `half1` with the year replaced by `year2`. This satisfies the inferred relation as it tests if the `withYear` method correctly replaces the year value while keeping the same half value.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 1900;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 1901;
int year3 = 1901;
int half3 = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year3, half3), YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2));
```
Explanation:
In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 1900 and `half1` is set to 2. The `year2` is set to 1901. The `year3` is set to 1901 and `half3` is set to 2. The follow-up input asserts that the `YearHalf` instance created using `year3` and `half3` is equal to the `YearHalf` instance created using `year1` and `half1` with the year replaced by `year2`. This satisfies the inferred relation as it tests if the `withYear` method correctly replaces the year value while keeping the same half value.
