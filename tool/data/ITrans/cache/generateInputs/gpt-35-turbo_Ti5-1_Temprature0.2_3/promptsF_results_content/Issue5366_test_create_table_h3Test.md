## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p5 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 4);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p5 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5 , REMAINDER 4);";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input, except that the whitespace and formatting should be normalized. In this case, the source input `sql` is already in the correct format, so the follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p6 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 2);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p6 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6 , REMAINDER 2);";
```

Explanation: Similar to the previous case, the source input `sql` is already in the correct format, so the follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p7 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 5);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p7 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7 , REMAINDER 5);";
```

Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the source input `sql` is already in the correct format, so the follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p8 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 6);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p8 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8 , REMAINDER 6);";
```

Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the source input `sql` is already in the correct format, so the follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p9 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 9, REMAINDER 1);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p9 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 9 , REMAINDER 1);";
```

Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the source input `sql` is already in the correct format, so the follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input.

In all the new input pairs, the follow-up inputs are the same as the source inputs because the `normalizeSql` method does not modify the input if it is already in the correct format. Therefore, the follow-up inputs will pass the assertions in the original test case.
