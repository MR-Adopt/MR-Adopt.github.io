## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method returns the same value for two `Cost` objects if and only if their `value` fields are equal. In the original test case, `subject` and `same` have the same `value` of 10, so their hash codes are equal. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can choose a `subject` with a different `value` than 10, such as 0, and a `other` with a different `value` than 11, such as 1.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method returns the same value for two `Cost` objects if and only if their `value` fields are equal. In the original test case, `subject` and `same` have the same `value` of 10, so their hash codes are equal. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can choose a `subject` with a different `value` than 10, such as `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, and a `other` with a different `value` than 11, such as `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-10);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-11);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method returns the same value for two `Cost` objects if and only if their `value` fields are equal. In the original test case, `subject` and `same` have the same `value` of 10, so their hash codes are equal. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can choose a `subject` with a different `value` than 10, such as -10, and a `other` with a different `value` than 11, such as -11.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000001);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method returns the same value for two `Cost` objects if and only if their `value` fields are equal. In the original test case, `subject` and `same` have the same `value` of 10, so their hash codes are equal. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can choose a `subject` with a different `value` than 10, such as 1000000, and a `other` with a different `value` than 11, such as 1000001.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method returns the same value for two `Cost` objects if and only if their `value` fields are equal. In the original test case, `subject` and `same` have the same `value` of 10, so their hash codes are equal. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can choose a `subject` with a different `value` than 10, such as 1, and a `other` with a different `value` than 11, such as 2.
