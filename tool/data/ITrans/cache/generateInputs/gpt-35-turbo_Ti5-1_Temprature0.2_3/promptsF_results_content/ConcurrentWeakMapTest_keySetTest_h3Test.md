## New input pair0:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(1, 6);
    map.put(2, 6);
    map.put(3, 6);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation between the source input `anotherMap` and the follow-up input `map` is that both maps have the same key set. In the original test case, `anotherMap` has keys 5, 4, and 3, and `map` also has the same keys. 

For the new source input, `anotherMap` has keys 1, 2, and 3. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `map` should have the same keys. Therefore, we initialize `map` with keys 1, 2, and 3, and assign the same value 6 to all the keys.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(10, 20);
    anotherMap.put(20, 30);
    anotherMap.put(30, 40);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(10, 6);
    map.put(20, 6);
    map.put(30, 6);
```

Explanation: 
Similar to the previous explanation, the inferred relation is that both maps have the same key set. In the original test case, `anotherMap` has keys 5, 4, and 3, and `map` also has the same keys. 

For the new source input, `anotherMap` has keys 10, 20, and 30. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `map` should have the same keys. Therefore, we initialize `map` with keys 10, 20, and 30, and assign the same value 6 to all the keys.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(100, 200);
    anotherMap.put(200, 300);
    anotherMap.put(300, 400);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(100, 6);
    map.put(200, 6);
    map.put(300, 6);
```

Explanation: 
Again, the inferred relation is that both maps have the same key set. In the original test case, `anotherMap` has keys 5, 4, and 3, and `map` also has the same keys. 

For the new source input, `anotherMap` has keys 100, 200, and 300. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `map` should have the same keys. Therefore, we initialize `map` with keys 100, 200, and 300, and assign the same value 6 to all the keys.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(0, 0);
    anotherMap.put(1, 1);
    anotherMap.put(2, 2);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(0, 6);
    map.put(1, 6);
    map.put(2, 6);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that both maps have the same key set. In the original test case, `anotherMap` has keys 5, 4, and 3, and `map` also has the same keys. 

For the new source input, `anotherMap` has keys 0, 1, and 2. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `map` should have the same keys. Therefore, we initialize `map` with keys 0, 1, and 2, and assign the same value 6 to all the keys.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(-1, -2);
    anotherMap.put(-2, -3);
    anotherMap.put(-3, -4);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(-1, 6);
    map.put(-2, 6);
    map.put(-3, 6);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that both maps have the same key set. In the original test case, `anotherMap` has keys 5, 4, and 3, and `map` also has the same keys. 

For the new source input, `anotherMap` has keys -1, -2, and -3. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `map` should have the same keys. Therefore, we initialize `map` with keys -1, -2, and -3, and assign the same value 6 to all the keys.
