## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input (`element`) and the follow-up input (`element2`) is that they have the same key and value. 

## Explanation:
In the original test case, the `remove` method is called with `element2` as the input. The `remove` method checks if the element exists in the set by calling the `lookup` method. Since `element` and `element2` have the same key and value, the `lookup` method returns true and the element is removed from the set.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: 
In this new input pair, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key2") and value (2). This satisfies the inferred relation that the key and value of the two elements should be the same. Therefore, when the `remove` method is called with `element2` as the input, it will successfully remove the element from the set.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: 
In this new input pair, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key1") and value (2). This satisfies the inferred relation that the key and value of the two elements should be the same. Therefore, when the `remove` method is called with `element2` as the input, it will successfully remove the element from the set.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: 
In this new input pair, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key2") and value (1). This satisfies the inferred relation that the key and value of the two elements should be the same. Therefore, when the `remove` method is called with `element2` as the input, it will successfully remove the element from the set.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```
Explanation: 
In this new input pair, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key1") and value (1). This satisfies the inferred relation that the key and value of the two elements should be the same. Therefore, when the `remove` method is called with `element2` as the input, it will successfully remove the element from the set.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, null);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, null);
```
Explanation: 
In this new input pair, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key2") and value (2). This satisfies the inferred relation that the key and value of the two elements should be the same. Therefore, when the `remove` method is called with `element2` as the input, it will successfully remove the element from the set.
