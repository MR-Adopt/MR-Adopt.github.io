## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are different values. The `retryCount1` is set to 0 and `retryCount2` is set to 1. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are the same. This ensures that the `retryCount` value is different for each call to `getBlobServiceClient` method, which will result in different instances of `BlobServiceClient` being returned.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are different values. The `retryCount1` is set to 3 and `retryCount2` is set to 1. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are the same. This ensures that the `retryCount` value is different for each call to `getBlobServiceClient` method, which will result in different instances of `BlobServiceClient` being returned.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are different values. The `retryCount1` is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `retryCount2` is set to 1. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are the same. This ensures that the `retryCount` value is different for each call to `getBlobServiceClient` method, which will result in different instances of `BlobServiceClient` being returned.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are different values. The `retryCount1` is set to -1 and `retryCount2` is set to 1. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are the same. This ensures that the `retryCount` value is different for each call to `getBlobServiceClient` method, which will result in different instances of `BlobServiceClient` being returned.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
    Integer retryCount2 = 1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are different values. The `retryCount1` is set to null and `retryCount2` is set to 1. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are empty strings. This ensures that the `retryCount` value is different for each call to `getBlobServiceClient` method, which will result in different instances of `BlobServiceClient` being returned.
