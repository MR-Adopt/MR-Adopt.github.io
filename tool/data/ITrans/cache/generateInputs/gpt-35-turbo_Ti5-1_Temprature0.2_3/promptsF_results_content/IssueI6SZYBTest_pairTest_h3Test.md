## New input pair0:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(0, 0);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":0,\"value\":0}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair0 is constructed by setting the values of the `pair` object to 0. The `jsonString` is then created by manually constructing a JSON string with the corresponding key-value pairs. The `beanClass` is set to `Pair.class` to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `jsonString` is constructed in the same format as the original test case, with the key-value pairs representing the values of the `pair` object. The `beanClass` is also set correctly to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(-1, -1);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":-1,\"value\":-1}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair1 is constructed by setting the values of the `pair` object to -1. The `jsonString` is then created by manually constructing a JSON string with the corresponding key-value pairs. The `beanClass` is set to `Pair.class` to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `jsonString` is constructed in the same format as the original test case, with the key-value pairs representing the values of the `pair` object. The `beanClass` is also set correctly to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":2147483647,\"value\":2147483647}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair2 is constructed by setting the values of the `pair` object to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The `jsonString` is then created by manually constructing a JSON string with the corresponding key-value pairs. The `beanClass` is set to `Pair.class` to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `jsonString` is constructed in the same format as the original test case, with the key-value pairs representing the values of the `pair` object. The `beanClass` is also set correctly to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":-2147483648,\"value\":-2147483648}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair3 is constructed by setting the values of the `pair` object to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. The `jsonString` is then created by manually constructing a JSON string with the corresponding key-value pairs. The `beanClass` is set to `Pair.class` to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `jsonString` is constructed in the same format as the original test case, with the key-value pairs representing the values of the `pair` object. The `beanClass` is also set correctly to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(100, -100);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":100,\"value\":-100}";
    Class<Pair> beanClass = Pair.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair4 is constructed by setting the values of the `pair` object to 100 and -100. The `jsonString` is then created by manually constructing a JSON string with the corresponding key-value pairs. The `beanClass` is set to `Pair.class` to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `jsonString` is constructed in the same format as the original test case, with the key-value pairs representing the values of the `pair` object. The `beanClass` is also set correctly to indicate the type of object to be converted from JSON.
