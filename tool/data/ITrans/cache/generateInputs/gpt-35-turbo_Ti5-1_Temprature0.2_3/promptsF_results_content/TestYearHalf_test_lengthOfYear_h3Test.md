## New input pair0:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(0, 1);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new `YearHalf` object using the same year and half values as the source input. Since the year is 0, which is not a leap year, the expected length of the year is 365, which matches the assertion in the original test case.
