## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_YEAR;
    int half = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int year2 = Year.MIN_YEAR;
    int half2 = 1;
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that when the year and half values are the same, the resulting YearHalf objects will be equal. In the original test case, `test` and `test2` are created with the same year and half values, and they are expected to be equal. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can use the same year and half values for the follow-up input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = Year.MAX_YEAR;
    int half = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int year2 = Year.MAX_YEAR;
    int half2 = 2;
```
Explanation: 
Similar to the previous case, when the year and half values are the same, the resulting YearHalf objects will be equal. In this case, we use the maximum year value and the maximum half value of 2 to create the follow-up input, ensuring that it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int year2 = 2022;
    int half2 = 1;
```
Explanation: 
Again, when the year and half values are the same, the resulting YearHalf objects will be equal. In this case, we use a specific year value of 2022 and a half value of 1 to create the follow-up input, ensuring that it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2023;
    int half = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int year2 = 2023;
    int half2 = 2;
```
Explanation: 
Similar to the previous cases, when the year and half values are the same, the resulting YearHalf objects will be equal. In this case, we use a specific year value of 2023 and a half value of 2 to create the follow-up input, ensuring that it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    int year2 = 1999;
    int half2 = 2;
```
Explanation: 
Once again, when the year and half values are the same, the resulting YearHalf objects will be equal. In this case, we use a specific year value of 1999 and a half value of 2 to create the follow-up input, ensuring that it satisfies the inferred relation.
