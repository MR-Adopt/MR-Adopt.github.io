## New input pair0:
```java
String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";

XmlBuilder xmlBuilder = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
String xmlBuilder2 = xmlBuilder.asString();

// The follow-up input xmlBuilder2 is generated by parsing the source input XML using the parse() method and then converting the resulting XmlBuilder object to a string using the asString() method.
```

The new input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input xmlBuilder2 is obtained by performing the same operations on the source input XML as in the original test case. Therefore, it is expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Python\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/pythondev/underscore-python/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";

String xmlBuilder2 = xmlBuilder.asString();

// The follow-up input xmlBuilder2 is generated by parsing the source input XML using the parse() method and then converting the resulting XmlBuilder object to a string using the asString() method.
```

The new input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input xmlBuilder2 is obtained by performing the same operations on the source input XML as in the original test case. Therefore, it is expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair2:

String xmlBuilder2 = xmlBuilder.asString();

// The follow-up input xmlBuilder2 is generated by parsing the source input XML using the parse() method and then converting the resulting XmlBuilder object to a string using the asString() method.
```

The new input pair2 satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input xmlBuilder2 is obtained by performing the same operations on the source input XML as in the original test case. Therefore, it is expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"File\">/path/to/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";

String xmlBuilder2 = xmlBuilder.asString();

// The follow-up input xmlBuilder2 is generated by parsing the source input XML using the parse() method and then converting the resulting XmlBuilder object to a string using the asString() method.
```

The new input pair3 satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input xmlBuilder2 is obtained by performing the same operations on the source input XML as in the original test case. Therefore, it is expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <ApacheCommons language=\"Java\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://commons.apache.org/</Location>\n" + "  </ApacheCommons>\n" + "</Projects>";
