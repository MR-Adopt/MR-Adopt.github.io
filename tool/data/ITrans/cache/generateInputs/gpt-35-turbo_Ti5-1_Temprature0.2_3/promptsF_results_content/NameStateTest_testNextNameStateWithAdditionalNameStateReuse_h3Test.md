## New input pair0:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

Follow-up input:
```java
    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
    NameState result = nameState2.getNextNameState(key2);
    assertEquals(nextNameState, result);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `addNextNameState` method is called on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments. Then, `getNextNameState` is called on `nameState2` with `key2` as an argument, and the result is compared to `nextNameState`. In this new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nameState` and `nextNameState`. We also set `key` and `key2` to the same value. Finally, we call `addNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments, and call `getNextNameState` on `nameState2` with `key2` as an argument. The expected result is `nextNameState`, which is asserted in the follow-up input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "";
```

Follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
    NameState result = nameState.getNextNameState(key);
    assertEquals(nextNameState, result);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `addNextNameState` method is called on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments. Then, `getNextNameState` is called on `nameState` with `key` as an argument, and the result is compared to `nextNameState`. In this new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nameState` and `nextNameState`. We set `key` to an empty string. Then, we call `addNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments, and call `getNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key` as an argument. The expected result is `nextNameState`, which is asserted in the follow-up input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = null;
    String key = "key";
```

Follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
    NameState result = nameState.getNextNameState(key);
    assertEquals(nextNameState, result);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `addNextNameState` method is called on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments. Then, `getNextNameState` is called on `nameState` with `key` as an argument, and the result is compared to `nextNameState`. In this new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nameState` and set `nextNameState` to `null`. We also set `key` to "key". Then, we call `addNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments, and call `getNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key` as an argument. The expected result is `nextNameState`, which is `null`, and it is asserted in the follow-up input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key2";
```

Follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
    String key2 = "key2";
    NameState result = nameState.getNextNameState(key2);
    assertEquals(nextNameState, result);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `addNextNameState` method is called on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments. Then, `getNextNameState` is called on `nameState2` with `key2` as an argument, and the result is compared to `nextNameState`. In this new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nameState` and `nextNameState`. We set `key` to "key2". Then, we call `addNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments. We also set `key2` to "key2". Finally, we call `getNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key2` as an argument. The expected result is `nextNameState`, which is asserted in the follow-up input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    nextNameState.addNextNameState("key2", new NameState());
```

Follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
    String key2 = "key2";
    NameState result = nameState.getNextNameState(key2);
    assertNull(result);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `addNextNameState` method is called on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments. Then, `getNextNameState` is called on `nameState2` with `key2` as an argument, and the result is compared to `nextNameState`. In this new input pair, we create a new `NameState` object `nameState` and `nextNameState`. We set `key` to "key". Then, we call `addNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key` and `nextNameState` as arguments. We also call `addNextNameState` on `nextNameState` with "key2" and a new `NameState` object as arguments. Finally, we set `key2` to "key2" and call `getNextNameState` on `nameState` with `key2` as an argument. The expected result is `null`, which is asserted in the follow-up input.
