## New input pair0:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("abc", 123);
    String jsonString = "{\"abc\":123}";
    Class beanClass = AbstractMap.SimpleEntry.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair0 is constructed by replacing the key and value of the source input pair with "abc" and 123 respectively. The jsonString is constructed by creating a JSON object with the key-value pair "abc":123. The beanClass remains the same as the original test case. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same structure and format as the original test case, where the key-value pair is converted to a JSON string and then converted back to a Map.Entry object.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("xyz", 0);
    String jsonString = "{\"xyz\":0}";
    Class beanClass = AbstractMap.SimpleEntry.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair1 is constructed by replacing the key and value of the source input pair with "xyz" and 0 respectively. The jsonString is constructed by creating a JSON object with the key-value pair "xyz":0. The beanClass remains the same as the original test case. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same structure and format as the original test case, where the key-value pair is converted to a JSON string and then converted back to a Map.Entry object.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("key", -100);
    String jsonString = "{\"key\":-100}";
    Class beanClass = AbstractMap.SimpleEntry.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair2 is constructed by replacing the key and value of the source input pair with "key" and -100 respectively. The jsonString is constructed by creating a JSON object with the key-value pair "key":-100. The beanClass remains the same as the original test case. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same structure and format as the original test case, where the key-value pair is converted to a JSON string and then converted back to a Map.Entry object.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>("", 999);
    String jsonString = "{\"\":999}";
    Class beanClass = AbstractMap.SimpleEntry.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair3 is constructed by replacing the key and value of the source input pair with an empty string and 999 respectively. The jsonString is constructed by creating a JSON object with the key-value pair "":999. The beanClass remains the same as the original test case. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same structure and format as the original test case, where the key-value pair is converted to a JSON string and then converted back to a Map.Entry object.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Map.Entry<String, Integer> pair = new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>(null, null);
    String jsonString = "{\"null\":null}";
    Class beanClass = AbstractMap.SimpleEntry.class;
```
Explanation: 
The follow-up input pair4 is constructed by replacing the key and value of the source input pair with null. The jsonString is constructed by creating a JSON object with the key-value pair "null":null. The beanClass remains the same as the original test case. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same structure and format as the original test case, where the key-value pair is converted to a JSON string and then converted back to a Map.Entry object.
