## New input pair0:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 1;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, n);
    int position2 = 1;
```

Explanation: 
In the original test case, the `setAtomAt` method is called with `n` and `position` as arguments. This sets the atom at the specified position in the `association` object. The `association2` object is then created with `n` and `o` as arguments. The `getAtomAt` method is called with `position2` as an argument, which should return the atom at the specified position in the `association2` object.

To generate the follow-up input, we can create a new `association2` object with the same atoms as the `association` object, but with `n` at the specified position. The `position2` should be the same as `position` to ensure that the same atom is retrieved from the `association2` object.
