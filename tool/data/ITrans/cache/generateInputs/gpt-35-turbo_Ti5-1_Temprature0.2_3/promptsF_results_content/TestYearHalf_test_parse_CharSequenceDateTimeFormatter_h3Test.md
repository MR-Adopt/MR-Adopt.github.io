## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input `year` and `half` values correspond to the values in the original test case's `text` input. The original test case asserts that the `YearHalf.parse` method should return `YearHalf.of(year, half)`, so by setting `year` to 2020 and `half` to 2, the assertion will pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input `year` and `half` values correspond to the values in the original test case's `text` input. The original test case asserts that the `YearHalf.parse` method should return `YearHalf.of(year, half)`, so by setting `year` to 1999 and `half` to 1, the assertion will pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input `year` and `half` values correspond to the values in the original test case's `text` input. The original test case asserts that the `YearHalf.parse` method should return `YearHalf.of(year, half)`, so by setting `year` to 2022 and `half` to 2, the assertion will pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2005;
    int half = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input `year` and `half` values correspond to the values in the original test case's `text` input. The original test case asserts that the `YearHalf.parse` method should return `YearHalf.of(year, half)`, so by setting `year` to 2005 and `half` to 1, the assertion will pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2030;
    int half = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input `year` and `half` values correspond to the values in the original test case's `text` input. The original test case asserts that the `YearHalf.parse` method should return `YearHalf.of(year, half)`, so by setting `year` to 2030 and `half` to 2, the assertion will pass.
