## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added to them in the same order. Therefore, when `getEventsInternal()` is called on both filters, the returned lists will be copies of the original lists and not the same object reference.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added to them in the same order, including duplicates. Therefore, when `getEventsInternal()` is called on both filters, the returned lists will be copies of the original lists and not the same object reference.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(null);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(null);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added to them in the same order, including a `null` event. Therefore, when `getEventsInternal()` is called on both filters, the returned lists will be copies of the original lists and not the same object reference.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(new FilterEventMock());
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added to them in the same order, including a new `FilterEventMock` object. Therefore, when `getEventsInternal()` is called on both filters, the returned lists will be copies of the original lists and not the same object reference.
