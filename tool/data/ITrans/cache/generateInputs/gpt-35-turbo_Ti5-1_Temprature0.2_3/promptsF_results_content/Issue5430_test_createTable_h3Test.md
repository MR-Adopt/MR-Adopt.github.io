## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint)";
```

The inferred relation is that the `normalizeSql` method removes unnecessary spaces and replaces single quotes with double quotes in the SQL string. In this case, the original SQL string does not contain any unnecessary spaces or single quotes, so the follow-up input should be the same as the source input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

The inferred relation is the same as in the previous case. The `normalizeSql` method removes unnecessary spaces and replaces single quotes with double quotes in the SQL string. In this case, the original SQL string does not contain any unnecessary spaces or single quotes, so the follow-up input should be the same as the source input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

The inferred relation is the same as in the previous cases. The `normalizeSql` method removes unnecessary spaces and replaces single quotes with double quotes in the SQL string. In this case, the original SQL string does not contain any unnecessary spaces or single quotes, so the follow-up input should be the same as the source input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) PARTITIONED BY (c int) STORED AS PARQUET";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) PARTITIONED BY (c int) STORED AS PARQUET";
```

The inferred relation is the same as in the previous cases. The `normalizeSql` method removes unnecessary spaces and replaces single quotes with double quotes in the SQL string. In this case, the original SQL string does not contain any unnecessary spaces or single quotes, so the follow-up input should be the same as the source input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) LOCATION '/path/to/data' STORED AS ORC";
    String newSql = "CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) LOCATION '/path/to/data' STORED AS ORC";
```

The inferred relation is the same as in the previous cases. The `normalizeSql` method removes unnecessary spaces and replaces single quotes with double quotes in the SQL string. In this case, the original SQL string does not contain any unnecessary spaces or single quotes, so the follow-up input should be the same as the source input.
