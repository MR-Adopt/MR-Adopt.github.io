## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Explanation: In the original test case, `job2Detail` is created using `newJob` method and `job22` is created using `new JobKey` method with the same parameters. Both `job2Detail` and `job22` have the same identity, i.e., "job2" and GROUP_KEY. Hence, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().usingJobData("key1", "value1").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `job2Detail` is created with additional job data using `usingJobData` method. However, the identity of `job2Detail` and `job22` remains the same, i.e., "job2" and GROUP_KEY. Hence, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("Job Description").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `job2Detail` is created with additional description using `withDescription` method. However, the identity of `job2Detail` and `job22` remains the same, i.e., "job2" and GROUP_KEY. Hence, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().usingJobData("key1", "value1").withDescription("Job Description").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `job2Detail` is created with additional job data using `usingJobData` method and additional description using `withDescription` method. However, the identity of `job2Detail` and `job22` remains the same, i.e., "job2" and GROUP_KEY. Hence, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().usingJobData("key1", "value1").withDescription("Job Description").usingJobData("key2", "value2").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `job2Detail` is created with additional job data using `usingJobData` method, additional description using `withDescription` method, and additional job data using `usingJobData` method again. However, the identity of `job2Detail` and `job22` remains the same, i.e., "job2" and GROUP_KEY. Hence, this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
