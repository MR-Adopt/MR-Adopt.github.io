## New input pair0:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(2, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(2);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
```
The inferred relation is that the size of the `transformed2` matrix should be the same as the size of the `input` matrix. In this case, the `input` matrix has a size of 2, so the `transformed2` matrix should also have a size of 2.

## New input pair1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(8, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(8);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
```
The inferred relation is that the size of the `transformed2` matrix should be the same as the size of the `input` matrix. In this case, the `input` matrix has a size of 8, so the `transformed2` matrix should also have a size of 8.

## New input pair2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(16, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(16);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
```
The inferred relation is that the size of the `transformed2` matrix should be the same as the size of the `input` matrix. In this case, the `input` matrix has a size of 16, so the `transformed2` matrix should also have a size of 16.

## New input pair3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(5, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(5);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
```
The inferred relation is that the size of the `transformed2` matrix should be the same as the size of the `input` matrix. In this case, the `input` matrix has a size of 5, so the `transformed2` matrix should also have a size of 5.

## New input pair4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(10, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(10);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
```
The inferred relation is that the size of the `transformed2` matrix should be the same as the size of the `input` matrix. In this case, the `input` matrix has a size of 10, so the `transformed2` matrix should also have a size of 10.

In all the new input pairs, the size of the `transformed2` matrix is set to be the same as the size of the `input` matrix. This ensures that the `transformed2` matrix will have the correct dimensions to store the transformed values.
