## Inferred Relation
Based on the given test case and the code under test, it can be inferred that the `isLowerThan` method of the `Version` class compares two versions and returns `true` if the first version is lower than the second version.

The comparison is done by splitting the versions into major, minor, revision, and build components. The major, minor, and revision components are compared numerically, while the build component is ignored for the comparison.

## Explanation
To satisfy the inferred relation and pass the assertions in the original test case, we need to generate follow-up inputs that have the first version lower than the second version.

For the given source input `v1 = "1.0"`, we can generate a follow-up input `v2 = "1.10"` where the major version of `v2` is greater than the major version of `v1`, making `v1` lower than `v2`.

## New input pair:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.10";
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.10";
```

The follow-up input pair `v1 = "1.0"` and `v2 = "1.10"` satisfies the inferred relation because the major version of `v1` is lower than the major version of `v2`, making `v1` lower than `v2`.
