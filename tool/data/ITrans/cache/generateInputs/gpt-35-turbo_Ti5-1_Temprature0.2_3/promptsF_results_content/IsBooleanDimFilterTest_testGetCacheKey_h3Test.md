## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `f3` and the follow-up input `f4` is that they have the same values for the `field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` properties.

## Explanation
The method `IsFalseDimFilter.of()` creates a new instance of `IsFalseDimFilter` by passing a `DimFilter` object as a parameter. In the original test case, `f3` and `f4` are created using the `EqualityFilter` constructor and then passed to `IsFalseDimFilter.of()` to create `f1_3` and `f1_4` respectively.

Since `f3` and `f4` have the same values for all properties (`field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension`), the resulting `IsFalseDimFilter` objects (`f1_3` and `f1_4`) will also have the same values for their properties.

## New input pair 0:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "", null);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for all properties (`field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension`). Therefore, when passed to `IsFalseDimFilter.of()`, they will create `IsFalseDimFilter` objects with the same property values, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous input pair, both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for all properties (`field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension`). Hence, when passed to `IsFalseDimFilter.of()`, they will create `IsFalseDimFilter` objects with the same property values, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for all properties (`field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension`). When passed to `IsFalseDimFilter.of()`, they will create `IsFalseDimFilter` objects with the same property values, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, 123, null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, 123, null);
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous input pairs, both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for all properties (`field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension`). When passed to `IsFalseDimFilter.of()`, they will create `IsFalseDimFilter` objects with the same property values, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, both `f3` and `f4` have the same values for all properties (`field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension`). When passed to `IsFalseDimFilter.of()`, they will create `IsFalseDimFilter` objects with the same property values, satisfying the inferred relation.
