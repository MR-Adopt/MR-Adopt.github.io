## New input pair0:
```java
String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
XmlBuilder xmlBuilder = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
String xmlBuilder2Json = xmlBuilder.toJson();
```

Explanation: The original test case asserts that the JSON representation of `XML` is equal to the JSON representation of `xmlBuilder2`. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can directly use the `XmlBuilder` object created from `XML` as the follow-up input `xmlBuilder2`.
