## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 192168000001L;
```
Explanation: The method `ipv4ToLong` converts the IP address string to a long value by splitting the string into four parts and converting each part to a long value. The follow-up input `ipLong2` is generated by concatenating the four parts of the IP address string `ipStr1` and converting it to a long value.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 100000000001L;
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous input pair, the follow-up input `ipLong2` is generated by concatenating the four parts of the IP address string `ipStr1` and converting it to a long value.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 172016000001L;
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous input pairs, the follow-up input `ipLong2` is generated by concatenating the four parts of the IP address string `ipStr1` and converting it to a long value.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "255.255.255.255";
    long ipLong2 = 255255255255L;
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous input pairs, the follow-up input `ipLong2` is generated by concatenating the four parts of the IP address string `ipStr1` and converting it to a long value.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "0.0.0.0";
    long ipLong2 = 0L;
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous input pairs, the follow-up input `ipLong2` is generated by concatenating the four parts of the IP address string `ipStr1` and converting it to a long value.

The follow-up inputs are generated by following the same logic as the original test case. The IP address strings are split into four parts and converted to long values by concatenating them. The follow-up inputs satisfy the inferred relation that the long value representation of an IP address can be converted back to the IP address string representation using the `longToIpv4` method.
