## Inferred Relation:
The `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method creates a `YearHalf` object by taking a year and a half as input. The `YearHalf` class represents a year and a half of a year. The `with(Year)` method of the `YearHalf` class replaces the year component of the `YearHalf` object with the specified year.

Based on the original test case, it can be inferred that the `with(Year)` method replaces the year component of the `YearHalf` object with the specified year, while keeping the half component unchanged.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2005;
    int year3 = 2005;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2000 and the `half1` is set to 1. The `year2` is set to 2005. The `year3` is set to 2005, which is the same as `year2`. The `half3` is set to 1, which is the same as `half1`. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year component of the `YearHalf` object with the specified year, while keeping the half component unchanged.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year1 = 2021;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int year3 = 2022;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2021 and the `half1` is set to 2. The `year2` is set to 2022. The `year3` is set to 2022, which is the same as `year2`. The `half3` is set to 2, which is the same as `half1`. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year component of the `YearHalf` object with the specified year, while keeping the half component unchanged.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year1 = 1999;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 1999 and the `half1` is set to 1. The `year2` is set to 2000. The `year3` is set to 2000, which is the same as `year2`. The `half3` is set to 1, which is the same as `half1`. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year component of the `YearHalf` object with the specified year, while keeping the half component unchanged.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year1 = 2022;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2021;
    int year3 = 2021;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2022 and the `half1` is set to 2. The `year2` is set to 2021. The `year3` is set to 2021, which is the same as `year2`. The `half3` is set to 2, which is the same as `half1`. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year component of the `YearHalf` object with the specified year, while keeping the half component unchanged.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1901;
    int year3 = 1901;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 1900 and the `half1` is set to 1. The `year2` is set to 1901. The `year3` is set to 1901, which is the same as `year2`. The `half3` is set to 1, which is the same as `half1`. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year component of the `YearHalf` object with the specified year, while keeping the half component unchanged.
