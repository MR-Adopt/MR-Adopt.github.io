## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input (`i2cMux`, `deviceBus`) and the follow-up input (`i2cMux2`) is that when the `setDeviceBus` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceBus` value, the `getDeviceBus` method called on `i2cMux2` should return the same `deviceBus` value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "0";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceBus` value of "0". Then, the `getDeviceBus` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceBus` value of "0".

## New input pair 1:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "7";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceBus` value of "7". Then, the `getDeviceBus` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceBus` value of "7".

## New input pair 2:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "3";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceBus` value of "3". Then, the `getDeviceBus` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceBus` value of "3".

## New input pair 3:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "2";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceBus` value of "2". Then, the `getDeviceBus` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceBus` value of "2".

## New input pair 4:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "5";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `setDeviceBus` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceBus` value of "5". Then, the `getDeviceBus` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceBus` value of "5".
