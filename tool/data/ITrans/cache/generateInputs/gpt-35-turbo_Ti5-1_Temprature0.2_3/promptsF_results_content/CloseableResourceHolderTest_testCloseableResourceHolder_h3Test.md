## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `holder2` should be created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object as the source input.

Explanation: The original test case asserts that the `get()` method of the `ResourceHolder` returns the same `closeable` object that was passed to the `fromCloseable()` method. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can create a new `ResourceHolder` object `holder2` using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object as the source input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `holder2` should be created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object as the source input.

Explanation: Similar to the previous case, the source input is a `Socket` object, and the inferred relation requires creating a new `ResourceHolder` object `holder2` using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `holder2` should be created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object as the source input.

Explanation: The source input is a `ByteArrayOutputStream` object, and the inferred relation requires creating a new `ResourceHolder` object `holder2` using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new StringReader("Hello, World!");
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `holder2` should be created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object as the source input.

Explanation: The source input is a `StringReader` object, and the inferred relation requires creating a new `ResourceHolder` object `holder2` using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new PipedOutputStream();
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `holder2` should be created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object as the source input.

Explanation: The source input is a `PipedOutputStream` object, and the inferred relation requires creating a new `ResourceHolder` object `holder2` using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor with the same `closeable` object.
