## New input pair0:

    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);

    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 44, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 44, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0 };

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original source input. The `now` variable is set to a specific `ZonedDateTime` value, the `jw` variable is initialized with a specific size, and the `lts` array is filled with the `now` value. The `manifest`, `body`, and `size` variables are set to the same values as in the original test case. Therefore, this new input pair should pass the assertions in the original test case.
