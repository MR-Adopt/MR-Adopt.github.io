# Inferred Relation
Based on the code provided, it can be inferred that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` input. The formula used to calculate `expected` is `((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1`.

# Explanation
To generate the follow-up input for the new source input, we need to calculate the `expected` value based on the month value of the `date` input.

# New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

In this case, the `date` input is set to July 1, 2022. The month value is 7, so the `expected` value will be calculated as `((7 - 1) / 6) + 1`, which equals 2. Therefore, the `expected` value will be 2.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same formula to calculate the `expected` value based on the month value of the `date` input.
