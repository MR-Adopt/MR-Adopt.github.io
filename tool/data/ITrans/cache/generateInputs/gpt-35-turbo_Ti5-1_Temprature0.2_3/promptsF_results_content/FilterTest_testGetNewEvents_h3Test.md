## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = null;
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `add` method is not called on `filter` or `filter2` before calling `getNewEvents()`. Therefore, both `filter` and `filter2` are empty. By setting `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` to `null`, we can create empty filters for both `filter` and `filter2`, ensuring that the `getNewEvents()` method returns an empty array for both filters.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = null;
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `add` method is not called on `filter` or `filter2` before calling `getNewEvents()`. Therefore, both `filter` and `filter2` are empty. By setting `filter` and `filter2` to `null`, we can create empty filters for both `filter` and `filter2`, ensuring that the `getNewEvents()` method returns an empty array for both filters.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `getNewEvents()` method is called on `filter2` after adding `mockEvent2` to it. By adding `mockEvent2` twice to `filter2`, we can ensure that the `getNewEvents()` method returns an array containing `mockEvent2.getJsonEventObject()` twice.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(null);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(null);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `getNewEvents()` method is called on `filter2` after adding `mockEvent2` to it. By adding `null` to both `filter` and `filter2`, we can ensure that the `getNewEvents()` method returns an array containing `mockEvent.getJsonEventObject()` and `mockEvent2.getJsonEventObject()`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(new FilterEventMock());
    filter2.add(new FilterEventMock());
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `getNewEvents()` method is called on `filter2` after adding `mockEvent2` to it. By adding two additional `FilterEventMock` objects to both `filter` and `filter2`, we can ensure that the `getNewEvents()` method returns an array containing `mockEvent.getJsonEventObject()` and `mockEvent2.getJsonEventObject()`.
