## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `value` and the follow-up inputs `message` and `clazz` is as follows:

- The `value` is encrypted using the `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method and stored in the `encryptedValue` variable.
- The `encryptedValue` is then assigned to the `message` variable.
- The `clazz` variable is assigned the class type of `Long`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
Long value = 0L;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `value` is set to `0L`. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the `value` and store it in the `message` variable. The `clazz` variable is assigned the class type of `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.

## New input pair 1:
```java
Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `value` is set to `Long.MAX_VALUE`. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the `value` and store it in the `message` variable. The `clazz` variable is assigned the class type of `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.

## New input pair 2:
```java
Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `value` is set to `Long.MIN_VALUE`. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the `value` and store it in the `message` variable. The `clazz` variable is assigned the class type of `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.

## New input pair 3:
```java
Long value = random.nextLong();
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `value` is set to a random `Long` value generated using `random.nextLong()`. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the `value` and store it in the `message` variable. The `clazz` variable is assigned the class type of `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.

## New input pair 4:
```java
Long value = 123456789L;
String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, the `value` is set to `123456789L`. The `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method is used to encrypt the `value` and store it in the `message` variable. The `clazz` variable is assigned the class type of `Long`. This input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it follows the same pattern as the original test case.
