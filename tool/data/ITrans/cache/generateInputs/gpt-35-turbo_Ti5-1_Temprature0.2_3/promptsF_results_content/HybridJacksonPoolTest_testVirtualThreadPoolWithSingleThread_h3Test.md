## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `virtualPool` and the follow-up input `virtualPool2` is that they should be instances of the same `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` class and have the same capacity value.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `virtualPool` is created with a capacity of 4. After acquiring and releasing a pooled resource, the `virtualPool` size is checked and found to be 1. Then, a new `virtualPool2` is created with the same capacity of 4. The previously released pooled resource is then released again using `virtualPool2.releasePooled(pooledResource)`. Finally, it is asserted that `virtualPool2.acquirePooled()` returns the same pooled resource that was released.

To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `virtualPool2` should be created with the same capacity value as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair0:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are created with a capacity of 0, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation: Here, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are created with a capacity of 10, which matches the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are created with a capacity of -1, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: Here, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are created with the maximum integer value as the capacity, which adheres to the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are created with the minimum integer value as the capacity, satisfying the inferred relation.
