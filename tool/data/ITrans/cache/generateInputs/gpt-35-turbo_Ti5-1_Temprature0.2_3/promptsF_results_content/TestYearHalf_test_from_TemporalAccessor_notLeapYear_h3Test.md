# Inferred Relation
Based on the given original test case and the code under test, we can infer the following relation between the source inputs (`date`) and the follow-up inputs (`year` and `expected`):

- The `year` is extracted from the `date` by calling `date.getYear()`.
- The `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date` using the formula `((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1`.

# New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = date.getYear();
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

Explanation: 
- In this new input pair, we set the `date` to `LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1)`, which represents July 1, 2022.
- The `year` is extracted from the `date` using `date.getYear()`, which gives us `2022`.
- The `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date` using the formula `((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1`, which gives us `2` since the month value is `7`.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case. The `year` is extracted correctly from the `date`, and the `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date` using the same formula.
