## Inferred Relation
The `isHigherThan` method of the `Version` class compares two versions and returns `true` if the first version is higher than the second version. The comparison is done based on the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of the versions.

In the given test case, the source input `v1` is `"1.0"` and the follow-up input `v2` is `"1.10"`. The expected result is `false`, indicating that `v1` is not higher than `v2`.

From the code of the `valueOf` method, we can infer the following relation between the source input `v1` and the follow-up input `v2`:
- If the major version number of `v1` is greater than the major version number of `v2`, then `v1` is higher than `v2`.
- If the major version numbers of `v1` and `v2` are equal, but the minor version number of `v1` is greater than the minor version number of `v2`, then `v1` is higher than `v2`.
- If the major and minor version numbers of `v1` and `v2` are equal, but the revision number of `v1` is greater than the revision number of `v2`, then `v1` is higher than `v2`.
- If the major, minor, and revision numbers of `v1` and `v2` are equal, but the build number of `v1` is greater than the build number of `v2`, then `v1` is higher than `v2`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `v1` has the same major, minor, and revision numbers as `v2`, but it has a build number (`A1`) which is greater than the build number of `v2` (null). Therefore, according to the inferred relation, `v1` is higher than `v2`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.0";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the major version number of `v1` is greater than the major version number of `v2`. Therefore, according to the inferred relation, `v1` is higher than `v2`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `v1` has the same major, minor, and revision numbers as `v2`, but it has a build number (`A1`) which is greater than the build number of `v2` (null). Therefore, according to the inferred relation, `v1` is higher than `v2`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0";
    String v2 = "1.10";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the major version number of `v1` is greater than the major version number of `v2`. Therefore, according to the inferred relation, `v1` is higher than `v2`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0-A1";
    String v2 = "2.0";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `v1` has the same major, minor, and revision numbers as `v2`, but it has a build number (`A1`) which is greater than the build number of `v2` (null). Therefore, according to the inferred relation, `v1` is higher than `v2`.
