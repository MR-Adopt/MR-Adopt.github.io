## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `quarter1`) and the follow-up inputs (`year2`, `quarter2`, `amount`) is that the follow-up inputs are used to add a certain amount of quarters to the source inputs. The resulting `YearQuarter` object is then compared with the expected `YearQuarter` object.

## Explanation
The original test case adds `amount` quarters to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year2` and `quarter2`. The resulting `YearQuarter` object is expected to be equal to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year1` and `quarter1`.

To generate the follow-up inputs, we can use the same `year1` and `quarter1` values as the source inputs. We can then choose different values for `year2`, `quarter2`, and `amount` to test different scenarios.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 1;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 3;
int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 2 quarters to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year2` and `quarter2`. The resulting `YearQuarter` object should be equal to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year1` and `quarter1`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 2;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 4;
int amount = 3;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 3 quarters to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year2` and `quarter2`. The resulting `YearQuarter` object should be equal to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year1` and `quarter1`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 3;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 1;
int amount = 4;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 4 quarters to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year2` and `quarter2`. The resulting `YearQuarter` object should be equal to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year1` and `quarter1`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 4;
int year2 = 2024;
int quarter2 = 1;
int amount = 5;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 5 quarters to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year2` and `quarter2`. The resulting `YearQuarter` object should be equal to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year1` and `quarter1`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 2024;
int quarter1 = 1;
int year2 = 2024;
int quarter2 = 2;
int amount = 6;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds 6 quarters to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year2` and `quarter2`. The resulting `YearQuarter` object should be equal to the `YearQuarter` object created from `year1` and `quarter1`.
