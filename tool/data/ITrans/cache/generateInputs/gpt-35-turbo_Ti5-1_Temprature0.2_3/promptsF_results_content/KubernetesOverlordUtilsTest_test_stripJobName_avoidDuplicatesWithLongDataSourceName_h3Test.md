The method `convertTaskIdToJobName` takes a `taskId` as input and converts it into a `jobName`. The `jobName` is generated by removing a specific pattern from the `taskId`, converting it to lowercase, and then appending a hash of the `taskId`.

From the original test case, we can infer that the `jobName` should be different for different `taskId` values. This means that if we change any part of the `taskId`, the resulting `jobName` should also change.

Based on this inference, we can generate the follow-up inputs for the new source inputs as follows:

## New input pair0:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_118_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
    String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_117_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
In this case, we have changed the last digit of the `taskId1` from `116` to `118`. This change should result in a different `jobName` compared to the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.417Z";
    String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
In this case, we have changed the last digit of the `taskId2` from `416` to `417`. This change should result in a different `jobName` compared to the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:12.416Z";
    String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
In this case, we have changed the second from the last digit of the `taskId1` from `1` to `2`. This change should result in a different `jobName` compared to the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:54:11.416Z";
    String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
In this case, we have changed the minute value of the `taskId1` from `53` to `54`. This change should result in a different `jobName` compared to the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T17:53:11.416Z";
    String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
In this case, we have changed the hour value of the `taskId1` from `16` to `17`. This change should result in a different `jobName` compared to the original test case.

The follow-up inputs for the new source inputs satisfy the inferred relation because they introduce changes in different parts of the `taskId`, which should result in different `jobName` values.
