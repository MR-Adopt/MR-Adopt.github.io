## Inferred Relation:
The method `computeNumSegmentsToMoveToBalanceTier` is used to compute the number of segments that need to be moved across the historicals in a tier to attain balance in terms of disk usage and segment counts per data source. 

The method `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` is used to calculate the number of segments to be picked for moving in the given tier, based on the level of skew between the historicals in the tier. It calls the `computeNumSegmentsToMoveToBalanceTier` method to get the number of segments to move and then returns the minimum of `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` and the number of segments to move.

The relation between the source inputs and the follow-up inputs is as follows:
- The `tier` and `historicals` in the source input are used as is in the follow-up input.
- The `tier2` in the follow-up input is the same as `tier` in the source input.
- The `historicals2` in the follow-up input is the same as `historicals` in the source input.
- The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` in the follow-up input is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

## New input pair0:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it has the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `tier2` and `historicals2` are also the same as the source input. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` which ensures that there is no limit on the maximum number of segments allowed to be moved in the tier.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String tier = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it has the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `tier2` and `historicals2` are also the same as the source input.

```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it has the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `tier2` and `historicals2` are also the same as the source input.
