## New input pair0:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half.getValue());
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new `YearHalf` object using the same year and half value as the original test case. The `YearHalf.of()` method is used to create the `test2` object, and the `half.getValue()` method is used to get the integer value of the `Half` enum. This ensures that the `test2` object is created with the same year and half value as the original test case, allowing it to pass the assertion in the original test case.
