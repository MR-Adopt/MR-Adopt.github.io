## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input (`ap`) and the follow-up input (`type`) is that the `type` should be the same as the `activityType` of the `ap` object.

## Explanation:
The `addActivityParams` method adds the `params` object to the `ScoringConfigGroup` object. Before adding, it checks if there is already an existing `ActivityParams` object with the same `activityType`. If there is, it removes the existing object and replaces it with the new one. The `activityType` is obtained from the `params` object using the `getActivityType()` method.

In the original test case, the `ap` object is created with an `activityType` of "type1". The `addActivityParams` method is called with this `ap` object. Then, the `getActivityParams` method is called with the `type` variable set to "type1". The assertion checks if the returned `ActivityParams` object is equal to the `ap` object.

Based on this understanding, we can generate the follow-up inputs by creating new `ActivityParams` objects with different `activityType` values and setting the `type` variable to the same value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type2");
String type = "type2";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ap` object is created with an `activityType` of "type2". The `type` variable is set to "type2", which matches the `activityType` of the `ap` object.

## New input pair 1:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type3");
String type = "type3";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ap` object is created with an `activityType` of "type3". The `type` variable is set to "type3", which matches the `activityType` of the `ap` object.

## New input pair 2:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type4");
String type = "type4";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ap` object is created with an `activityType` of "type4". The `type` variable is set to "type4", which matches the `activityType` of the `ap` object.

## New input pair 3:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type5");
String type = "type5";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ap` object is created with an `activityType` of "type5". The `type` variable is set to "type5", which matches the `activityType` of the `ap` object.

## New input pair 4:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type6");
String type = "type6";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ap` object is created with an `activityType` of "type6". The `type` variable is set to "type6", which matches the `activityType` of the `ap` object.
