## New input pair0:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
    boolean trimFlag2 = true;
```

Inferred relation: The length of the extracted array (`ex`) should be greater than or equal to the length of the extracted array (`et`).

Explanation: In the original test case, `trimFlag` is set to `false` and `trimFlag2` is set to `true`. This means that the `_data` array will be returned as is when `trimFlag` is `false`, and a trimmed version of the `_data` array will be returned when `trimFlag2` is `true`. Since the trimmed version of the array will always have a length less than or equal to the original array, the assertion `ex.length >= et.length` will always be true.

For the new input pair, `trimFlag` is set to `true` and `trimFlag2` is also set to `true`. This means that both `ex` and `et` will be trimmed versions of the `_data` array. Since both arrays are trimmed versions, the length of `ex` will always be greater than or equal to the length of `et`, satisfying the inferred relation.

Complete code for the new input pair0:
```java
@Test
public void extract() {
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(0);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
    boolean trimFlag2 = true;
    int[] ex = a.extractValues(trimFlag);
    int[] et = a.extractValues(trimFlag2);
    assertTrue(ex.length >= et.length);
}
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = false;
    boolean trimFlag2 = false;
```

Inferred relation: The length of the extracted array (`ex`) should be equal to the length of the extracted array (`et`).

Explanation: In the original test case, `trimFlag` is set to `false` and `trimFlag2` is set to `true`. This means that the `_data` array will be returned as is when `trimFlag` is `false`, and a trimmed version of the `_data` array will be returned when `trimFlag2` is `true`. Since the trimmed version of the array will always have a length less than or equal to the original array, the assertion `ex.length >= et.length` will always be true.

For the new input pair, `trimFlag` is set to `false` and `trimFlag2` is also set to `false`. This means that both `ex` and `et` will be the original `_data` array without any trimming. Since both arrays are the original arrays, the length of `ex` will always be equal to the length of `et`, satisfying the inferred relation.

Complete code for the new input pair1:
```java
@Test
public void extract() {
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(0);
    boolean trimFlag = false;
    boolean trimFlag2 = false;
    int[] ex = a.extractValues(trimFlag);
    int[] et = a.extractValues(trimFlag2);
    assertTrue(ex.length == et.length);
}
