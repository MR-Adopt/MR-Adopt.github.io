## New input1:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive), which is not specified in the code snippet but assumed to be defined elsewhere. The `quarter1` value is also within the valid range of 1 to 4.

## New input2:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive), and the `quarter1` value is within the valid range of 1 to 4.

## New input3:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive), and the `quarter1` value is within the valid range of 1 to 4.

## New input4:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive), and the `quarter1` value is within the valid range of 1 to 4.

## New input5:
```java
    int year1 = 2024;
    int quarter1 = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive), and the `quarter1` value is within the valid range of 1 to 4. Additionally, the `year1` value is different from the original test case, providing a different scenario to test.
