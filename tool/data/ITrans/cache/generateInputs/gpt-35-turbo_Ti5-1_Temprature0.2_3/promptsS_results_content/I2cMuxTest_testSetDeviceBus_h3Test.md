## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it explores the lower bound of the valid range for `deviceBus`, which is "0".

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it explores the upper bound of the valid range for `deviceBus`, which is "7".

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the valid range for `deviceBus`, which is "0" to "7".

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "2";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the valid range for `deviceBus`, which is "0" to "7".

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "5";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the valid range for `deviceBus`, which is "0" to "7".
