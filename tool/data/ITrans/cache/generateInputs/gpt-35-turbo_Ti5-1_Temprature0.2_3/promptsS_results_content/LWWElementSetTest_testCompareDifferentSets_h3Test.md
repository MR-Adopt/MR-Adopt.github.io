## New input1:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: In this input, the timestamp of the element is set to 0. This is a valid input as the timestamp can be any non-negative integer.

## New input2:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: In this input, the timestamp of the element is set to the maximum value of the integer data type. This is a valid input as the timestamp can be any non-negative integer.

## New input3:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", 100, bias);
```
Explanation: In this input, the timestamp of the element is set to a positive integer value. This is a valid input as the timestamp can be any non-negative integer.

## New input4:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", -1, bias);
```
Explanation: In this input, the timestamp of the element is set to a negative value. This is a valid input as the timestamp can be any non-negative integer.

## New input5:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: In this input, the timestamp of the element is set to the minimum value of the integer data type. This is a valid input as the timestamp can be any non-negative integer.
