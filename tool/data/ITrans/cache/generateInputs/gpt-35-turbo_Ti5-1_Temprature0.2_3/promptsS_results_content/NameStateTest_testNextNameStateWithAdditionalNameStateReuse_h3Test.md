## New input1:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when an empty string is used as the key.

## New input2:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = null;
    String key = "key";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when a null value is used as the `nextNameState`.

## New input3:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key2";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when a different key is used to retrieve the `nextNameState` than the one used to add it.

## New input4:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = new NameState();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when a different `NameState` object is used to add the `nextNameState` than the one used to retrieve it.

## New input5:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    nextNameState.addNextNameState("key2", new NameState());
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when a `nextNameState` object itself contains another `nextNameState` object.
