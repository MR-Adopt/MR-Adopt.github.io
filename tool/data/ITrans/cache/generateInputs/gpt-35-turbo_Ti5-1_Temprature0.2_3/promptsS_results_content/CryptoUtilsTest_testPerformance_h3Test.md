## New input1:
```java
    Long value = 0L;

## New input2:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the value to be encrypted is the maximum value that can be represented by a Long.

## New input3:
```java
    Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the value to be encrypted is the minimum value that can be represented by a Long.

## New input4:
```java
    Long value = random.nextLong();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the value to be encrypted is a random Long value.

## New input5:
```java
    Long value = 123456789L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the value to be encrypted is a specific Long value.
