## New input1:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new SequentialUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a different implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface, namely `SequentialUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it provides an alternative implementation for generating UUIDs, which may have different behavior compared to the `RandomUuidGenerator` used in the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new CustomUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a custom implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface, namely `CustomUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it allows for further customization of the UUID generation logic, which may be useful for testing specific scenarios or requirements.

## New input3:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new CachedUuidGenerator(new RandomUuidGenerator());
```
Explanation: This input uses a decorator pattern to wrap the `RandomUuidGenerator` with a `CachedUuidGenerator`. The `CachedUuidGenerator` caches generated UUIDs to improve performance. It is valid because it tests the behavior of the `CachedUuidGenerator` implementation and its interaction with the underlying `RandomUuidGenerator`.

## New input4:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new SecureRandomUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a different implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface, namely `SecureRandomUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it provides a more secure way of generating random UUIDs using a `SecureRandom` instance, which may be important for certain applications that require strong randomness.

## New input5:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new TimeBasedUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a different implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface, namely `TimeBasedUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it generates UUIDs based on the current timestamp, which can be useful for testing scenarios that require time-based ordering or uniqueness.
