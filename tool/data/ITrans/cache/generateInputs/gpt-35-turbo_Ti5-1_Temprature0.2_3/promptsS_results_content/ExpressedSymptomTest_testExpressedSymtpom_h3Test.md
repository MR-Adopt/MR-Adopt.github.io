## New input1:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module1";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this test input, the symptom name is set to "fever" and the module name is set to "module1". These values are valid because they are non-null strings, which are the expected input types for the `ExpressedSymptom` constructor and `addressSource` method.

## New input2:
```java
    String name = "cough";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module2";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this test input, the symptom name is set to "cough" and the module name is set to "module2". These values are valid because they are non-null strings, which are the expected input types for the `ExpressedSymptom` constructor and `addressSource` method.

## New input3:
```java
    String name = "headache";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module3";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this test input, the symptom name is set to "headache" and the module name is set to "module3". These values are valid because they are non-null strings, which are the expected input types for the `ExpressedSymptom` constructor and `addressSource` method.

## New input4:
```java
    String name = "fatigue";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module4";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this test input, the symptom name is set to "fatigue" and the module name is set to "module4". These values are valid because they are non-null strings, which are the expected input types for the `ExpressedSymptom` constructor and `addressSource` method.

## New input5:
```java
    String name = "nausea";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module5";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this test input, the symptom name is set to "nausea" and the module name is set to "module5". These values are valid because they are non-null strings, which are the expected input types for the `ExpressedSymptom` constructor and `addressSource` method.
