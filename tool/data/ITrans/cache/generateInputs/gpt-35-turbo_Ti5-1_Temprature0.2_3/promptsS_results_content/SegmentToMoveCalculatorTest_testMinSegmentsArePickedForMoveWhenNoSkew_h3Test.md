## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where there are no segments in the tier. It ensures that the method handles the edge case correctly.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where there is only one segment in the tier. It ensures that the method handles the case of a minimal number of segments correctly.

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where there is a large number of segments in the tier. It ensures that the method can handle a high number of segments and still calculate the minimum segments to move correctly.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 50_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where there is a moderate number of segments in the tier. It ensures that the method can handle a range of segment counts and calculate the minimum segments to move correctly.

## New input5:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the total number of segments in the tier is at the maximum value. It ensures that the method can handle the maximum value and calculate the minimum segments to move correctly.
