## New input1:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` are both valid values of 1, representing the first half of the year.

## New input2:
```java
    int year1 = 2022;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` are both valid values of 2, representing the second half of the year.

## New input3:
```java
    int year1 = 1999;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` are both valid values of 1 and 2, representing the first and second half of the year respectively.

## New input4:
```java
    int year1 = 2025;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` are both valid values of 1 and 2, representing the first and second half of the year respectively.

## New input5:
```java
    int year1 = 2030;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` are both valid values of 1 and 2, representing the first and second half of the year respectively.
