## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p5 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 4);";
```
Explanation: This input creates a new table called "orders_p5" which is a partition of the "orders" table. It specifies the partitioning criteria as "MODULUS 5" and "REMAINDER 4".

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p6 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 2);";
```
Explanation: This input creates a new table called "orders_p6" which is a partition of the "orders" table. It specifies the partitioning criteria as "MODULUS 6" and "REMAINDER 2".

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p7 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 5);";
```
Explanation: This input creates a new table called "orders_p7" which is a partition of the "orders" table. It specifies the partitioning criteria as "MODULUS 7" and "REMAINDER 5".

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p8 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 6);";
```
Explanation: This input creates a new table called "orders_p8" which is a partition of the "orders" table. It specifies the partitioning criteria as "MODULUS 8" and "REMAINDER 6".

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p9 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 9, REMAINDER 1);";
```
Explanation: This input creates a new table called "orders_p9" which is a partition of the "orders" table. It specifies the partitioning criteria as "MODULUS 9" and "REMAINDER 1".

These new inputs are valid because they follow the same pattern as the original input, creating new partition tables with different partitioning criteria.
