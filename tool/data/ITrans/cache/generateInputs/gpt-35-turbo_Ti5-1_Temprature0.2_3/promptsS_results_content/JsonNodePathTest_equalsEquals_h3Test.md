## New input1:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a different value than the original test input. It helps to verify if the `append` method correctly handles different input values.

## New input2:
```java
    String token1 = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `append` method when an empty string is passed as the input. It helps to verify if the method handles empty strings correctly.

## New input3:
```java
    String token1 = "123";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `append` method when a numeric string is passed as the input. It helps to verify if the method can handle different types of input values.

## New input4:
```java
    String token1 = "a.b";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `append` method when a string with a dot (.) character is passed as the input. It helps to verify if the method can handle special characters in the input.

## New input5:
```java
    String token1 = "A";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the `append` method when an uppercase letter is passed as the input. It helps to verify if the method is case-sensitive and can handle different letter cases.
