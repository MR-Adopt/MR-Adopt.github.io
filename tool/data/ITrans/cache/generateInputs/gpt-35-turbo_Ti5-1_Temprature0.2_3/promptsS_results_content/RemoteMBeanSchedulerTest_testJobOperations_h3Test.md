## New input1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().usingJobData("key1", "value1").build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a job data map to the job detail. The job data map can be used to pass additional data to the job when it is executed.

## New input2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("Job Description").build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a description to the job detail. The description can be used to provide additional information about the job.

## New input3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().usingJobData("key1", "value1").withDescription("Job Description").build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it combines the previous two inputs, adding both a job data map and a description to the job detail.

## New input4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().usingJobData("key1", "value1").withDescription("Job Description").usingJobData("key2", "value2").build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds multiple entries to the job data map. It demonstrates the ability to pass multiple key-value pairs to the job when it is executed.

## New input5:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().usingJobData("key1", "value1").withDescription("Job Description").usingJobData("key2", "value2").usingJobData("key3", "value3").build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds another entry to the job data map. It further demonstrates the ability to pass multiple key-value pairs to the job when it is executed.
