## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where the `StripedLockFreePool` is created with 0 threads. It is valid because the program should handle the case where the pool size is 0.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where the `StripedLockFreePool` is created with a larger number of threads (10). It is valid because the program should be able to handle a larger pool size.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where the `StripedLockFreePool` is created with a negative number of threads. It is valid because the program should handle the case where the pool size is negative.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where the `StripedLockFreePool` is created with the maximum possible number of threads. It is valid because the program should be able to handle the maximum pool size.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where the `StripedLockFreePool` is created with the minimum possible number of threads. It is valid because the program should be able to handle the minimum pool size.
