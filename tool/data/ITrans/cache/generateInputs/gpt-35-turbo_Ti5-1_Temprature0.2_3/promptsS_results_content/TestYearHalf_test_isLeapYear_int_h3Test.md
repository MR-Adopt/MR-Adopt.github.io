## New input1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 0;
```
This input is valid because the minimum value for the `year` parameter is `MIN_YEAR`, which is defined in the code but not shown. Assuming `MIN_YEAR` is a constant with a value of 0, this input represents the minimum valid value for `year`.

## New input2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 9999;
```
This input is valid because the maximum value for the `year` parameter is `MAX_YEAR`, which is defined in the code but not shown. Assuming `MAX_YEAR` is a constant with a value of 9999, this input represents the maximum valid value for `year`.

## New input3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2000;
```
This input is valid because it represents a leap year. According to the method `isLeapYear()`, a year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4 without remainder. Since 2000 is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.

## New input4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2024;
```
This input is valid because it represents a leap year. Similar to the previous input, 2024 is divisible by 4 without remainder, making it a leap year.

## New input5:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 1800;
```
This input is valid because it represents a non-leap year. According to the method `isLeapYear()`, a year is not considered a leap year if it is divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. Since 1800 is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year.
