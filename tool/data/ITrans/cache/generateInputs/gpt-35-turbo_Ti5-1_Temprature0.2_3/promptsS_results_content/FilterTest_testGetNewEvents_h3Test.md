## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are setting `mockEvent` to `null` to test the behavior of the program when `add()` method is called with a `null` event. This is a valid test input as the program should handle the case when a `null` event is added to the filter.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are setting `filter` to `null` to test the behavior of the program when `getNewEvents()` method is called on a `null` filter. This is a valid test input as the program should handle the case when `getNewEvents()` method is called on a `null` filter and return an appropriate response.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are adding the same `mockEvent` twice to the `filter` to test the behavior of the program when duplicate events are added. This is a valid test input as the program should handle the case when duplicate events are added and not include duplicates in the result of `getNewEvents()`.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(null);
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are adding `null` event to the `filter` to test the behavior of the program when `add()` method is called with a `null` event. This is a valid test input as the program should handle the case when a `null` event is added to the filter.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are adding two new instances of `FilterEventMock` to the `filter` to test the behavior of the program when multiple events are added. This is a valid test input as the program should handle the case when multiple events are added and include all the events in the result of `getNewEvents()`.
