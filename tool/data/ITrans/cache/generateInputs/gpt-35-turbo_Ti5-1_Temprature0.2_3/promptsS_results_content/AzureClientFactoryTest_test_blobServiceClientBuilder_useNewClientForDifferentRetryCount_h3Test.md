```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to a positive value, indicating the number of retries to be attempted.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to the maximum possible value, indicating that the maximum number of retries should be attempted.

## New input4:

    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
