# New input pair0:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the cache keys of `f1_3` and `f1_4` should be the same. Since `f3` and `f4` have the same field name, column type, value, and filter context, their cache keys should be the same.

# New input pair1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the cache keys of `f1_3` and `f1_4` should be the same. Since `f3` and `f4` have the same field name, column type, value, and filter context, their cache keys should be the same.

# New input pair2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the cache keys of `f1_3` and `f1_4` should be the same. Since `f3` and `f4` have the same field name, column type, value, and filter context, their cache keys should be the same.

# New input pair3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the cache keys of `f1_3` and `f1_4` should be the same. Since `f3` and `f4` have the same field name, column type, value, and filter context, their cache keys should be the same.

# New input pair4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "");
```

Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "");
```
