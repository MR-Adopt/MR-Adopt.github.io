## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should equal `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half2` is 2, `withHalf(half2)` will result in `YearHalf.of(year1, 2)`, which is equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should equal `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half2` is 1, `withHalf(half2)` will result in `YearHalf.of(year1, 1)`, which is equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should equal `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half2` is 1, `withHalf(half2)` will result in `YearHalf.of(year1, 1)`, which is equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should equal `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half2` is 2, `withHalf(half2)` will result in `YearHalf.of(year1, 2)`, which is equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 3;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 3;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 3;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 3;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should equal `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half2` is 3, `withHalf(half2)` will result in `YearHalf.of(year1, 3)`, which is equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.
