## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input (`date`) and the follow-up input (`year` and `expected`) is that the `year` and `expected` values are derived from the month value of the `date` object. The `expected` value is calculated by dividing the month value minus 1 by 6 and adding 1. This relation is generalizable across valid input pairs.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
