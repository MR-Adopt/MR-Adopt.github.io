## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the original test case's requirement of comparing the internal events list of two different filters. In this case, `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with the same `mockEvent1`, and their internal events lists are compared. Since they are initialized with the same `mockEvent1`, their internal events lists are the same, and the assertion `assertNotSame(events, filter2.getEventsInternal())` will pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the original test case's requirement of comparing the internal events list of two different filters. In this case, `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with the same `mockEvent2`, and their internal events lists are compared. Since they are initialized with the same `mockEvent2`, their internal events lists are the same, and the assertion `assertNotSame(events, filter2.getEventsInternal())` will pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the original test case's requirement of comparing the internal events list of two different filters. In this case, `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with no events, and their internal events lists are compared. Since they are initialized with no events, their internal events lists are the same, and the assertion `assertNotSame(events, filter2.getEventsInternal())` will pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the original test case's requirement of comparing the internal events list of two different filters. In this case, `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with the same `mockEvent1` added twice, and their internal events lists are compared. Since they are initialized with the same `mockEvent1` added twice, their internal events lists are the same, and the assertion `assertNotSame(events, filter2.getEventsInternal())` will pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
