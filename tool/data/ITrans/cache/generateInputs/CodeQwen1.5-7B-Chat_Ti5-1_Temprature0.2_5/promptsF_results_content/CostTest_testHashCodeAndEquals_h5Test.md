## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Generation of follow-up input: Since the hashCode method simply returns the value of the Cost object, a new Cost object with the same value as the subject can be used as the follow-up input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Generation of follow-up input: Since the hashCode method simply returns the value of the Cost object, a new Cost object with the same value as the subject can be used as the follow-up input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Generation of follow-up input: Since the hashCode method simply returns the value of the Cost object, a new Cost object with the same value as the subject can be used as the follow-up input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Generation of follow-up input: Since the hashCode method simply returns the value of the Cost object, a new Cost object with the same value as the subject can be used as the follow-up input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```
Generation of follow-up input: Since the hashCode method simply returns the value of the Cost object, a new Cost object with the same value as the subject can be used as the follow-up input.

All the new input pairs satisfy the inferred relation that the hashCode method returns the same value for two Cost objects if they have the same value.
