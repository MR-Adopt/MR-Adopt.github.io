## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the method under test is that the `normalizeSql` method is used to normalize the SQL statements. The `normalizeSql` method takes a string `sql` as input and returns a normalized version of the SQL statement. The normalized SQL statement is then used to compare with the expected result in the original test case.

The new input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation because it uses the same `normalizeSql` method to normalize the SQL statement. The original SQL statement `sql` is normalized to `newSql`, which is then used in the original test case to compare with the expected result.

The code used to generate the follow-up input is as follows:
```java
String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
String newSql = normalizeSql(sql);
```
This code first defines the original SQL statement `sql` and then normalizes it using the `normalizeSql` method. The normalized SQL statement `newSql` is then used in the original test case to compare with the expected result.
