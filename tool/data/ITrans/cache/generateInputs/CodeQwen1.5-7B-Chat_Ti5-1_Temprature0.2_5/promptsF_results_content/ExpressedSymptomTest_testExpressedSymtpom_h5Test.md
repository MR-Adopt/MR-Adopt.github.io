## New input pair0:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "medicalModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "medicalModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "medicalModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation because it addresses the same symptom from the same module. This is because the `addressSource` method is used to associate the symptom with the given module, and the `symptom2` variable is assigned the same value as `symptom`. Therefore, when the `onSet` method is called on `symptom2` with the same module and cause, it will update the data structure with the same information as `symptom`. This will ensure that the `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` method returns the same time as `symptom`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String name = "cough";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "homeModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "homeModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String name = "cough";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "homeModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation because it addresses the same symptom from the same module. This is because the `addressSource` method is used to associate the symptom with the given module, and the `symptom2` variable is assigned the same value as `symptom`. Therefore, when the `onSet` method is called on `symptom2` with the same module and cause, it will update the data structure with the same information as `symptom`. This will ensure that the `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` method returns the same time as `symptom`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String name = "headache";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "workModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "workModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String name = "headache";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "workModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input pair2 satisfies the inferred relation because it addresses the same symptom from the same module. This is because the `addressSource` method is used to associate the symptom with the given module, and the `symptom2` variable is assigned the same value as `symptom`. Therefore, when the `onSet` method is called on `symptom2` with the same module and cause, it will update the data structure with the same information as `symptom`. This will ensure that the `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` method returns the same time as `symptom`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String name = "rash";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "sportModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "sportModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String name = "rash";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "sportModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input pair3 satisfies the inferred relation because it addresses the same symptom from the same module. This is because the `addressSource` method is used to associate the symptom with the given module, and the `symptom2` variable is assigned the same value as `symptom`. Therefore, when the `onSet` method is called on `symptom2` with the same module and cause, it will update the data structure with the same information as `symptom`. This will ensure that the `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` method returns the same time as `symptom`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String name = "diarrhea";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "dietModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "dietModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String name = "diarrhea";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "dietModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input pair4 satisfies the inferred relation because it addresses the same symptom from the same module. This is because the `addressSource` method is used to associate the symptom with the given module, and the `symptom2` variable is assigned the same value as `symptom`. Therefore, when the `onSet` method is called on `symptom2` with the same module and cause, it will update the data structure with the same information as `symptom`. This will ensure that the `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` method returns the same time as `symptom`.
