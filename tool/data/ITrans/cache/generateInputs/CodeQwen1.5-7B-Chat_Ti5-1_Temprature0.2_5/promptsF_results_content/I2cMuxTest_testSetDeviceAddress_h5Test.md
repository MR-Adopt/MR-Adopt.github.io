## Explanation of the inferred relation and the corresponding follow-up input generation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the method under test is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class sets the device address of the i2cMux device, and the `getDeviceAddress` method returns the current device address. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, the new source input should start with an instance of `I2cMux`, set the device address using the `setDeviceAddress` method, and then verify that the device address is correctly set using the `getDeviceAddress` method. The corresponding follow-up input for each new source input is generated by running the `setDeviceAddress` method with the new device address and then verifying that the device address is correctly set using the `getDeviceAddress` method.
