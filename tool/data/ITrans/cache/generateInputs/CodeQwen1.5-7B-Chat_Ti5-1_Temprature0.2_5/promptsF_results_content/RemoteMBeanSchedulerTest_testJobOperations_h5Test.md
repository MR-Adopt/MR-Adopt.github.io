## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("A durable job").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("A durable job").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `addJob` method adds a job to the scheduler and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job details from the scheduler. The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a durable description, which is added to the scheduler using the `addJob` method. The `getJobDetail` method is then used to retrieve the job details from the scheduler, which should match the original job details.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withPriority(5).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withPriority(5).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `addJob` method adds a job to the scheduler and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job details from the scheduler. The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a priority, which is added to the scheduler using the `addJob` method. The `getJobDetail` method is then used to retrieve the job details from the scheduler, which should match the original job details.

## New input pair2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDurability(false).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDurability(false).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `addJob` method adds a job to the scheduler and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job details from the scheduler. The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a non-durable job, which is added to the scheduler using the `addJob` method. The `getJobDetail` method is then used to retrieve the job details from the scheduler, which should match the original job details.

## New input pair3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withJobData(new JobDataMap()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withJobData(new JobDataMap()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `addJob` method adds a job to the scheduler and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job details from the scheduler. The new source input `job2Detail` is created with job data, which is added to the scheduler using the `addJob` method. The `getJobDetail` method is then used to retrieve the job details from the scheduler, which should match the original job details.

## New input pair4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTriggers(newTrigger().withIdentity("trigger1", "group1").startNow().build()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTriggers(newTrigger().withIdentity("trigger1", "group1").startNow().build()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `addJob` method adds a job to the scheduler and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job details from the scheduler. The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a trigger, which is added to the scheduler using the `addJob` method. The `getJobDetail` method is then used to retrieve the job details from the scheduler, which should match the original job details.
