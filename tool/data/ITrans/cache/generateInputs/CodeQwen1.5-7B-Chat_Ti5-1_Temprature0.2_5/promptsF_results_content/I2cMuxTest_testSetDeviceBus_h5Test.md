## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `setDeviceBus` method of the `I2cMux` class sets the I2C bus for the `i2cMux` object, and the `getDeviceBus` method returns the current I2C bus. For the new source input `deviceBus = "0"`, the corresponding follow-up input is to create a new `I2cMux` object `i2cMux2`, set its I2C bus to `"0"`, and then assert that the `getDeviceBus` method of `i2cMux2` returns `"0"`. This satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the method's functionality with a valid input and verifies that the output matches the expected result.

## New input pair1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is the same as above. For the new source input `deviceBus = "7"`, the corresponding follow-up input is to create a new `I2cMux` object `i2cMux2`, set its I2C bus to `"7"`, and then assert that the `getDeviceBus` method of `i2cMux2` returns `"7"`. This satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the method's functionality with a valid input and verifies that the output matches the expected result.

## New input pair2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is the same as above. For the new source input `deviceBus = "3"`, the corresponding follow-up input is to create a new `I2cMux` object `i2cMux2`, set its I2C bus to `"3"`, and then assert that the `getDeviceBus` method of `i2cMux2` returns `"3"`. This satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the method's functionality with a valid input and verifies that the output matches the expected result.

## New input pair3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "2";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is the same as above. For the new source input `deviceBus = "2"`, the corresponding follow-up input is to create a new `I2cMux` object `i2cMux2`, set its I2C bus to `"2"`, and then assert that the `getDeviceBus` method of `i2cMux2` returns `"2"`. This satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the method's functionality with a valid input and verifies that the output matches the expected result.

## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation is the same as above. For the new source input `deviceBus = "8"`, the corresponding follow-up input is to create a new `I2cMux` object `i2cMux2`, set its I2C bus to `"8"`, and then assert that the `getDeviceBus` method of `i2cMux2` returns `"8"`. This satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the method's functionality with an invalid input (outside the valid range) and verifies that the output matches the expected result.
