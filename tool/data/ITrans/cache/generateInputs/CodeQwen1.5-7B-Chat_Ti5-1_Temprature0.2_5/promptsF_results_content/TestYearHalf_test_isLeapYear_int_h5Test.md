## New input pair0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2000;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input is used to create a `YearHalf` object, and the follow-up input is used to test the `isLeapYear` method of the `YearHalf` object. Since the source input is for a leap year, the follow-up input should also be for a leap year to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 1900;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input is used to create a `YearHalf` object, and the follow-up input is used to test the `isLeapYear` method of the `YearHalf` object. Since the source input is for a non-leap year, the follow-up input should also be for a non-leap year to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1900;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input is used to create a `YearHalf` object, and the follow-up input is used to test the `isLeapYear` method of the `YearHalf` object. Since the source input is for a non-leap year, the follow-up input should also be for a non-leap year to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 1600;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input is used to create a `YearHalf` object, and the follow-up input is used to test the `isLeapYear` method of the `YearHalf` object. Since the source input is for a leap year, the follow-up input should also be for a leap year to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1600;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the source input is used to create a `YearHalf` object, and the follow-up input is used to test the `isLeapYear` method of the `YearHalf` object.
