## New input pair0:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";

```

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_117_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```

### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the job names generated from the task IDs should be different. Since the task IDs are different, the job names should also be different. Therefore, the follow-up input is a different task ID with the same prefix as the source input.
