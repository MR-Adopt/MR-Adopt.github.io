## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 2);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the year are related. In the original test case, the year is 500 and the half is 1, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. In the new input pair, the year is 2020 and the half is 2, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. Since 2020 is a leap year, the length of the year is 366, which matches the expected result.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 1);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the year are related. In the original test case, the year is 500 and the half is 1, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. In the new input pair, the year is 1900 and the half is 1, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. Since 1900 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365, which matches the expected result.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 2);
```

The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the year are related. In the original test case, the year is 500 and the half is 1, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. In the new input pair, the year is 2000 and the half is 2, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. Since 2000 is a leap year, the length of the year is 366, which matches the expected result.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1600;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1600, 1);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the year are related. In the original test case, the year is 500 and the half is 1, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. In the new input pair, the year is 1600 and the half is 1, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. Since 1600 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365, which matches the expected result.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1800, 2);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the year are related. In the original test case, the year is 500 and the half is 1, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. In the new input pair, the year is 1800 and the half is 2, and the length of the year is calculated using the `lengthOfYear()` method. Since 1800 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365, which matches the expected result.
