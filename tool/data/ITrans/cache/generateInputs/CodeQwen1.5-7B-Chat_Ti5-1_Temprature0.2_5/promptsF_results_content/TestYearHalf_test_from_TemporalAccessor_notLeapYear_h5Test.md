## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, 6, 15);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 6, which corresponds to the second half of the year. Therefore, the expected year-half is 2.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2021, 12, 31);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 12, which corresponds to the second half of the year. Therefore, the expected year-half is 2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(1900, 1, 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 1, which corresponds to the first half of the year. Therefore, the expected year-half is 1.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2000, 2, 29);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 2, which corresponds to the first half of the year. Therefore, the expected year-half is 1.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2100, 2, 29);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is calculated based on the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 2, which corresponds to the first half of the year. Therefore, the expected year-half is 1.
