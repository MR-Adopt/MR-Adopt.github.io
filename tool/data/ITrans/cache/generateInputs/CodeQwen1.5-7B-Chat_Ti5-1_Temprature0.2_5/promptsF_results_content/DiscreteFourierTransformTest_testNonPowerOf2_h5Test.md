## New input pair0:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(8, 1, Uniform.of(-10, 20));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(8);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
        transformer.transform(input, DiscreteFourierTransform.DEFAULT, (PhysicalStore<ComplexNumber>) transformed2);
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same dimension as the original input and uses the same range of values. The `transform` method is called with the original input and the default transformation mode, followed by the `transform` method with the original input, the default transformation mode, and the `transformed2` store. This ensures that the `transformed2` store contains the same transformed values as the original input, which is verified by the assertion in the original test case.

```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(16, 1, Uniform.of(-100, 200));

        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
        transformer.transform(input, DiscreteFourierTransform.DEFAULT, (PhysicalStore<ComplexNumber>) transformed2);

        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(128);
