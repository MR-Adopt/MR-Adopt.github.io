## New input pair0:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two AuditInfo objects is equal if and only if their author, identity, comment, and ip fields are equal. Since the new source input has the same author, identity, comment, and ip fields as the original input, the hashCode of the new input should be equal to the hashCode of the original input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
```
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two AuditInfo objects is equal if and only if their author, identity, comment, and ip fields are equal. Since the new source input has the same author, identity, comment, and ip fields as the original input, the hashCode of the new input should be equal to the hashCode of the original input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");
```
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two AuditInfo objects is equal if and only if their author, identity, comment, and ip fields are equal. Since the new source input has the same author, identity, comment, and ip fields as the original input, the hashCode of the new input should be equal to the hashCode of the original input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
```
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two AuditInfo objects is equal if and only if their author, identity, comment, and ip fields are equal. Since the new source input has the same author, identity, comment, and ip fields as the original input, the hashCode of the new input should be equal to the hashCode of the original input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
```
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two AuditInfo objects is equal if and only if their author, identity, comment, and ip fields are equal. Since the new source input has the same author, identity, comment, and ip fields as the original input, the hashCode of the new input should be equal to the hashCode of the original input.
