## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = false;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = false;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` should be equal to the follow-up input `l2`, and the source input `b` should be equal to the follow-up input `b`. Since the source input `l` is 0, the follow-up input `l2` should also be 0. Similarly, since the source input `b` is false, the follow-up input `b` should also be false.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` should be equal to the follow-up input `l2`, and the source input `b` should be equal to the follow-up input `b`. Since the source input `l` is -1, the follow-up input `l2` should also be -1. Similarly, since the source input `b` is false, the follow-up input `b` should also be false.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = false;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = false;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` should be equal to the follow-up input `l2`, and the source input `b` should be equal to the follow-up input `b`. Since the source input `l` is Long.MAX_VALUE, the follow-up input `l2` should also be Long.MAX_VALUE. Similarly, since the source input `b` is false, the follow-up input `b` should also be false.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = 1;
    long l2 = 1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long l = 1;
    long l2 = 1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` should be equal to the follow-up input `l2`, and the source input `b` should be equal to the follow-up input `b`. Since the source input `l` is 1, the follow-up input `l2` should also be 1. Similarly, since the source input `b` is true, the follow-up input `b` should also be true.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = -2;
    long l2 = -2;
    boolean b = true;
```
Generation code:
```java
    long l = -2;
    long l2 = -2;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `l` should be equal to the follow-up input `l2`, and the source input `b` should be equal to the follow-up input `b`. Since the source input `l` is -2, the follow-up input `l2` should also be -2. Similarly, since the source input `b` is true, the follow-up input `b` should also be true.
