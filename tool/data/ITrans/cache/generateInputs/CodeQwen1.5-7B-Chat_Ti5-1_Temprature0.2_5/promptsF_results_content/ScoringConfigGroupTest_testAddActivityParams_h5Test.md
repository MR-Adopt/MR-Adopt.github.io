## New input pair0:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("transit");
    String type = "transit";
```
Generated follow-up input:
```java
    String type = "transit";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is the same as the follow-up input. This is because the method under test `addActivityParams` takes in an `ActivityParams` object and a `String` type as parameters. The source input `ap` is used to create an `ActivityParams` object, and the follow-up input `type` is used to retrieve the `ActivityParams` object from the `ScoringConfigGroup`. Since the source input and follow-up input are the same, the method under test will correctly retrieve the `ActivityParams` object from the `ScoringConfigGroup`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("walk");
    String type = "walk";
```
Generated follow-up input:
```java
    String type = "walk";
```
