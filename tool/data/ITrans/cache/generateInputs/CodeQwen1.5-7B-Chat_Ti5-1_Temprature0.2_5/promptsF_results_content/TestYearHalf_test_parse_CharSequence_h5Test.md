## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text representation adheres to the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H2";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text representation adheres to the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 3;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H3";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 3;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text representation adheres to the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H1";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the year-half is generated from the year and half using the `toString()` method of the `YearHalf` class. This ensures that the text representation adheres to the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H2";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
