## New input pair0:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(0);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
    boolean trimFlag2 = true;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the new input pair is that the `trimFlag` value should be the same as the `trimFlag2` value. In this case, the `trimFlag` is set to `true`, which means that the `extractValues` method should return a copy of the original data array. Since the `trimFlag2` is also set to `true`, the expected output should be the same as the original data array.

## New input pair1:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(0);
    boolean trimFlag = false;
    boolean trimFlag2 = false;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the new input pair is that the `trimFlag` value should be the same as the `trimFlag2` value. In this case, the `trimFlag` is set to `false`, which means that the `extractValues` method should return the original data array without trimming. Since the `trimFlag2` is also set to `false`, the expected output should be the same as the original data array.

## New input pair2:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(0);
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(0);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
    boolean trimFlag2 = false;
```
