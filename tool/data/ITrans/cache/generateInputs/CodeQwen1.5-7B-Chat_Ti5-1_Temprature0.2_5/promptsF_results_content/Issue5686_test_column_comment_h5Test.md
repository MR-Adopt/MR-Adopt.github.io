For each new source input listed under 'NEW SOURCE INPUTS', please construct the corresponding follow-up input that satisfies your inferred relation and pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'. Document the complete code for each new input pair in the format shown below:
## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "INSERT INTO TABLE_TEST_1(\n" + "\tDATE_ID,-- qianzhushi\n" + "\tCUS_NO -- houzhushi\n,\n" + "\tCUS_NAME\n" + ")\n" + "SELECT A.DATE_ID,\n" + "\tA.CUS_NO,\n" + "\tA.CUS_NAME\n" + "FROM TABLE_TEST_2 \n" + "WHERE COL1='1';";
    MySqlInsertStatement sqlStatement = (MySqlInsertStatement) SQLUtils.parseSingleStatement(sql, DbType.mysql, true);
    MySqlInsertStatement sqlStatement2 = (MySqlInsertStatement) SQLUtils.parseSingleStatement(sql, DbType.mysql, true);
```

Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the two `MySqlInsertStatement` objects are equivalent, except for the addition of comments to the columns. The original test case uses the same SQL statement to create two `MySqlInsertStatement` objects, and then compares their string representations to ensure they are equal. The new input pair satisfies this relation by creating a new `MySqlInsertStatement` object with the same SQL statement and then adding comments to the columns. The `toString()` method of the `MySqlInsertStatement` class is used to generate the string representation of the SQL statement, which is then parsed back into a `MySqlInsertStatement` object using the `SQLUtils.parseSingleStatement()` method. This ensures that the two `MySqlInsertStatement` objects are equivalent, except for the addition of comments to the columns.
