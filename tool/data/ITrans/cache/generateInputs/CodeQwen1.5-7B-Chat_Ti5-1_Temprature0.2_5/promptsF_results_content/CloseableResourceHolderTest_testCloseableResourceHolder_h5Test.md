## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` created from the `closeable` using the `fromCloseable` method. The new input pair satisfies this relation by creating a `Closeable` that does nothing when closed, and then creating a `CloseableResourceHolder` from it.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = System.out::close;
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = System.out::close;
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` created from the `closeable` using the `fromCloseable` method. The new input pair satisfies this relation by creating a `Closeable` that closes `System.out`, and then creating a `CloseableResourceHolder` from it.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` created from the `closeable` using the `fromCloseable` method. The new input pair satisfies this relation by creating a `Closeable` that throws an `IOException` when closed, and then creating a `CloseableResourceHolder` from it.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` created from the `closeable` using the `fromCloseable` method. The new input pair satisfies this relation by creating a `Closeable` that does nothing when closed, and then creating a `CloseableResourceHolder` from it.
