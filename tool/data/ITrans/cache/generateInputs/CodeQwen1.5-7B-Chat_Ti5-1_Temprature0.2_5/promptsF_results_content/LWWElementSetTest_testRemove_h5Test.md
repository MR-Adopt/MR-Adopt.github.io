# New input pair0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the 'element' and 'element2' should be the same, as they both have the same key, value, and bias. Therefore, the 'element2' is the follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 3, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 3, bias);
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the 'element' and 'element2' should be the same, as they both have the same key, value, and bias. Therefore, the 'element2' is the follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the 'element' and 'element2' should be the same, as they both have the same key, value, and bias. Therefore, the 'element2' is the follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias - 1);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, bias - 1);
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, bias - 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the 'element' and 'element2' should be the same, as they both have the same key, value, and bias. Therefore, the 'element2' is the follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the 'element' and 'element2' should be the same, as they both have the same key, value, and bias. Therefore, the 'element2' is the follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation.
