# New input pair0:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
    String token2 = "b";
```

Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token2 = "b";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "b", the follow-up input `token2` should also be "b" to satisfy the relation.

# New input pair1:
```java
    String token1 = "c";
    String token2 = "c";
```

Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token2 = "c";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "c", the follow-up input `token2` should also be "c" to satisfy the relation.

# New input pair2:
```java
    String token1 = "d";
    String token2 = "d";
```

Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token2 = "d";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "d", the follow-up input `token2` should also be "d" to satisfy the relation.

# New input pair3:
```java
    String token1 = "e";
    String token2 = "e";
```

Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token2 = "e";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "e", the follow-up input `token2` should also be "e" to satisfy the relation.

# New input pair4:
```java
    String token1 = "f";
    String token2 = "f";
```

Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token2 = "f";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `a1` and `a2` are equal if and only if `token1` and `token2` are equal. Since `token1` is "f", the follow-up input `token2` should also be "f" to satisfy the relation.
