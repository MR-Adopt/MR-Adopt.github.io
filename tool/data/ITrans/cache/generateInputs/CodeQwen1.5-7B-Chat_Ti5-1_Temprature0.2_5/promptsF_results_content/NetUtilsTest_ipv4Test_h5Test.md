## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.1.1";
    long ipLong2 = 3232235777L;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained by converting an IPv4 address to a long is equal to the long value obtained by converting the same IPv4 address to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method. The new source input "192.168.1.1" satisfies this relation because the long value obtained by converting it to a long is 3232235777L.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 167772161L;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained by converting an IPv4 address to a long is equal to the long value obtained by converting the same IPv4 address to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method. The new source input "10.0.0.1" satisfies this relation because the long value obtained by converting it to a long is 167772161L.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 2886723584L;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained by converting an IPv4 address to a long is equal to the long value obtained by converting the same IPv4 address to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method. The new source input "172.16.0.1" satisfies this relation because the long value obtained by converting it to a long is 2886723584L.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "8.8.8.8";
    long ipLong2 = 134744072L;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained by converting an IPv4 address to a long is equal to the long value obtained by converting the same IPv4 address to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method. The new source input "8.8.8.8" satisfies this relation because the long value obtained by converting it to a long is 134744072L.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "255.255.255.255";
    long ipLong2 = 4294967295L;
```
Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained by converting an IPv4 address to a long is equal to the long value obtained by converting the same IPv4 address to a long using the `ipv4ToLong` method. The new source input "255.255.255.255" satisfies this relation because the long value obtained by converting it to a long is 4294967295L.
