# New input pair0:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLOWORLD";
    String textTodecrypt = "WKHJJJJJJJ";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText.substring(0, 10);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text of the plaintext is the same as the first 10 characters of the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can take the first 10 characters of the encrypted text as the follow-up input.

# New input pair1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAMMING";
    String textTodecrypt = "KJJJJJJJJJ";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText.substring(0, 10);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text of the plaintext is the same as the first 10 characters of the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can take the first 10 characters of the encrypted text as the follow-up input.

# New input pair2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ENCRYPTION");
    String plaintext = "TESTCASE";
    String textTodecrypt = "JJJJJJJJJJ";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText.substring(0, 10);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text of the plaintext is the same as the first 10 characters of the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can take the first 10 characters of the encrypted text as the follow-up input.

# New input pair3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("CIPHER");
    String plaintext = "MESSAGE";
    String textTodecrypt = "JJJJJJJJJJ";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText.substring(0, 10);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text of the plaintext is the same as the first 10 characters of the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can take the first 10 characters of the encrypted text as the follow-up input.

# New input pair4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("PLAYFAIR");
    String plaintext = "PLAYFAIR";
    String textTodecrypt = "SHHAHRFB";
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String encryptedText = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
    String textTodecrypt = encryptedText.substring(0, 10);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text of the plaintext is the same as the first 10 characters of the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can take the first 10 characters of the encrypted text as the follow-up input.
