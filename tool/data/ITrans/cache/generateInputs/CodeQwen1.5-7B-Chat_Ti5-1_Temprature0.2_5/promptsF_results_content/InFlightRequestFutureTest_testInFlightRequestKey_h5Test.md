# New input pair0:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
```
Generation code:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group fields are equal. Since requestKey1 and requestKey2 have the same group field, their hashCodes should be equal.

# New input pair1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
```
Generation code:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group fields are equal. Since requestKey1 and requestKey2 have the same group field, their hashCodes should be equal.

# New input pair2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Generation code:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group fields are equal. Since requestKey1 and requestKey2 have the same group field, their hashCodes should be equal.

# New input pair3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 1);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 1);
```
Generation code:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 1);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 1);
```
