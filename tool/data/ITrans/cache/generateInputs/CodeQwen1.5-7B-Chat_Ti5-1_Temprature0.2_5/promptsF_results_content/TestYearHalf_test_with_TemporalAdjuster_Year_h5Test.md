# INFERRED RELATION
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year3` and `half3` should remain unchanged when the `year2` is applied to the `YearHalf` object created from `year1` and `half1`.

# FOLLOW-UP INPUTS
## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2025;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
The follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because the `year2` is applied to the `YearHalf` object created from `year1` and `half1`, resulting in the same `year3` and `half3` as the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 2;
```
The follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because the `year2` is applied to the `YearHalf` object created from `year1` and `half1`, resulting in the same `year3` and `half3` as the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2200;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 1;
```
The follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because the `year2` is applied to the `YearHalf` object created from `year1` and `half1`, resulting in the same `year3` and `half3` as the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1800;
    int half3 = 2;
```
The follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because the `year2` is applied to the `YearHalf` object created from `year1` and `half1`, resulting in the same `year3` and `half3` as the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 3000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 3050;
    int year3 = 3000;
    int half3 = 1;
```
The follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because the `year2` is applied to the `YearHalf` object created from `year1` and `half1`, resulting in the same `year3` and `half3` as the original test case.
