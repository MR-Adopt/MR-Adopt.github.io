## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha1";
    String v2 = "1.0-alpha2";
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha1";
    String v2 = "1.0-alpha2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "1.0-alpha1" is lexicographically smaller than "1.0-alpha2", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-beta2";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-beta3";
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-beta2";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-beta3";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "1.1.0-beta2" is lexicographically smaller than "1.1.0-beta3", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0.0-rc1";
    String v2 = "2.0.0-rc2";
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0.0-rc1";
    String v2 = "2.0.0-rc2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "2.0.0-rc1" is lexicographically smaller than "2.0.0-rc2", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "0.9";
    String v2 = "0.10";
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "0.9";
    String v2 = "0.10";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "0.9" is lexicographically smaller than "0.10", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` is lower than `v2` if `v1` is lexicographically smaller than `v2`. Since "1.0.0" is lexicographically smaller than "1.0.1", the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
