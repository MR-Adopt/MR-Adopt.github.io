## New input pair0:
```java
    String v = "2.0.0";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v = "2.0.0";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to `v` when `v` is a valid version string. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the original input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v = "1.1.0";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v = "1.1.0";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to `v` when `v` is a valid version string. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the original input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v = "1.0.1";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v = "1.0.1";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to `v` when `v` is a valid version string. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the original input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0-A1";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0-A1";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to `v` when `v` is a valid version string. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the original input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0+B1";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0+B1";
    Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
    assertEquals(v, version.stringOf());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to `v` when `v` is a valid version string. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the original input.
