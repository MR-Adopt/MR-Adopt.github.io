# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the difference between the quarters is equal to the amount. In this case, the difference between quarter 1 and quarter 3 is 2, which is equal to the amount of 1. Therefore, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the difference between the quarters is equal to the amount. In this case, the difference between quarter 2 and quarter 4 is 2, which is equal to the amount of 1. Therefore, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the difference between the quarters is equal to the amount. In this case, the difference between quarter 3 and quarter 1 is 2, which is equal to the amount of 1. Therefore, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the difference between the quarters is equal to the amount. In this case, the difference between quarter 4 and quarter 2 is 2, which is equal to the amount of 1. Therefore, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 5;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 5;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the difference between the quarters is equal to the amount. In this case, the difference between quarter 5 and quarter 3 is 2, which is equal to the amount of 1. Therefore, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
