## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since `v1` and `v2` are both "1.0-A1", they satisfy the relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since `v1` and `v2` are both "1.1.0", they satisfy the relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since `v1` and `v2` are both "1.1.0-A1", they satisfy the relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since `v1` and `v2` are both "1.0.0-A1", they satisfy the relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0.A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0.A1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0.A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0.A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the version numbers should be equal. Since `v1` and `v2` are both "1.0.0.A1", they satisfy the relation.
