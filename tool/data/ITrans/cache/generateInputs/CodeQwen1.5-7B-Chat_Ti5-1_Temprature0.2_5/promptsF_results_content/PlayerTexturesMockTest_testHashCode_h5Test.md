## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects is the same if and only if their skin URLs are the same. Since the source input `playerTexturesMock` has a different skin URL than `otherPlayerTexturesMock`, the new input pair satisfies this relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects is the same if and only if their skin URLs are the same. Since the source input `playerTexturesMock` has a null skin URL, the new input pair satisfies this relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects is the same if and only if their skin URLs are the same. Since the source input `playerTexturesMock` has a different skin URL than `otherPlayerTexturesMock`, the new input pair satisfies this relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(new ProfileProperty("textures", "value", "signature"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProperty(new ProfileProperty("textures", "value", "signature"));
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(new ProfileProperty("textures", "value", "signature"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProperty(new ProfileProperty("textures", "value", "signature"));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects is the same if and only if their skin URLs are the same. Since the source input `playerTexturesMock` has a different skin URL than `otherPlayerTexturesMock`, the new input pair satisfies this relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProperty(null);
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProperty(null);
```
