## New input pair0:
```java
    String element2 = "B";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
String element2 = "B";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is the element to be added to the set, and the follow-up input is the element that is not present in the set. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same pattern as the original test case.
