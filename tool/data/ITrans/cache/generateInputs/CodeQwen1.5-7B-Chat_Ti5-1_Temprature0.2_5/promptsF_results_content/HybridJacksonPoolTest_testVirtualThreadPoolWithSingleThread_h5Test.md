# REQUIRED DELIVERABLE
## New input pair0:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are initialized with the same capacity of 0. Therefore, when `virtualPool2` releases a pooled resource, it should be immediately acquired by `virtualPool`, as they share the same pool.

## New input pair1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are initialized with the same capacity of 1. Therefore, when `virtualPool2` releases a pooled resource, it should be immediately acquired by `virtualPool`, as they share the same pool.

## New input pair2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are initialized with the same capacity of 10. Therefore, when `virtualPool2` releases a pooled resource, it should be immediately acquired by `virtualPool`, as they share the same pool.

## New input pair3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are initialized with the same capacity of 100. Therefore, when `virtualPool2` releases a pooled resource, it should be immediately acquired by `virtualPool`, as they share the same pool.

## New input pair4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1000);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1000);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1000);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1000);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` are initialized with the same capacity of 1000. Therefore, when `virtualPool2` releases a pooled resource, it should be immediately acquired by `virtualPool`, as they share the same pool.
