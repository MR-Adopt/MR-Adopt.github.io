## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
    int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the minimum number of segments to move in a tier with a total segment count of 0. This is because the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is calculated based on the total segment count, and the total segment count is 0 in this case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
    int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the minimum number of segments to move in a tier with a total segment count of 1. This is because the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is calculated based on the total segment count, and the total segment count is 1 in this case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
    int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the minimum number of segments to move in a tier with a total segment count of 100. This is because the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is calculated based on the total segment count, and the total segment count is 100 in this case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
    int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the minimum number of segments to move in a tier with a total segment count of 10000. This is because the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is calculated based on the total segment count, and the total segment count is 10000 in this case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
    int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the minimum number of segments to move in a tier with a total segment count of Integer.MAX_VALUE. This is because the minimum number of segments to move in a tier is calculated based on the total segment count, and the total segment count is Integer.MAX_VALUE in this case.
