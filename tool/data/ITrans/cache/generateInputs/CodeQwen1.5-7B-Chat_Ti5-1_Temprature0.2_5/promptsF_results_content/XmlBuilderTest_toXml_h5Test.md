For each new source input listed under 'NEW SOURCE INPUTS', please construct the corresponding follow-up input that satisfies your inferred relation and pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'. Document the complete code for each new input pair in the format shown below:
## New input pair0:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <NewProject language=\"Python\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/newproject/newproject/</Location>\n" + "  </NewProject>\n" + "</Projects>";
```

Additionally, for each new source input, provide the code used to generate the follow-up input along with its associated source input code. Please explain why this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation you have identified.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <NewProject language=\"JavaScript\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/newproject/newproject/</Location>\n" + "  </NewProject>\n" + "</Projects>";
```

Additionally, for each new source input, provide the code used to generate the follow-up input along with its associated source input code. Please explain why this new input pair satisfies the inferred relation you have identified.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <NewProject language=\"Java\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/newproject/newproject/</Location>\n" + "  </NewProject>\n" + "</Projects>";
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <NewProject language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/newproject/newproject/</Location>\n" + "  </NewProject>\n" + "</Projects>";
