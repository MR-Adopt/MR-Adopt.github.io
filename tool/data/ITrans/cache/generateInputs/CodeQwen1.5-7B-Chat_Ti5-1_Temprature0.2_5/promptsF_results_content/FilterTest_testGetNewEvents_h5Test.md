## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the new input pair is that the `add` method of the `Filter` class adds an event to the filter, and the `getNewEvents` method returns the new events added to the filter. Since `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` have the same event details, adding `mockEvent2` to `filter2` should result in the same new events as adding `mockEvent` to `filter`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", null, "Description2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2", null, "Description2");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
