For the new source input0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```

Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the original SQL statement and the new SQL statement should be equivalent after normalization. The normalization process involves removing extra spaces, tabs, and newlines, replacing single quotes with double quotes, and ensuring that parentheses are properly formatted.

The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the original SQL statement and the new SQL statement are equivalent after normalization. The normalization process has removed extra spaces and tabs, replaced single quotes with double quotes, and formatted parentheses correctly. Therefore, the new SQL statement is a valid follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation.
