    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `parse` method of the `XmlBuilder` class should take a string input and return an `XmlBuilder` object. The source input `XML` is a string that represents an XML document. The follow-up input `xmlBuilder2` is the result of calling the `parse` method with the source input `XML`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `parse` method is the method under test, and it takes a string input and returns an `XmlBuilder` object.
