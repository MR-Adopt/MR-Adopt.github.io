## New input pair0:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
The inferred relation is that the number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the number of segments to move to fix skew. In this case, the number of segments to move to fix skew is the same as the number of segments to move in the tier.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
The inferred relation is that the number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the number of segments to move to fix skew. In this case, the number of segments to move to fix skew is the same as the number of segments to move in the tier.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
The inferred relation is that the number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the number of segments to move to fix skew. In this case, the number of segments to move to fix skew is the same as the number of segments to move in the tier.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", Collections.emptyList()));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", Collections.emptyList()));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
The inferred relation is that the number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the number of segments to move to fix skew. In this case, the number of segments to move to fix skew is the same as the number of segments to move in the tier.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()));
    String tier2 = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
The inferred relation is that the number of segments to move in a tier is equal to the number of segments to move to fix skew. In this case, the number of segments to move to fix skew is the same as the number of segments to move in the tier.
