## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account1";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account1";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are related to each other. Since `retryCount1` is `3` and `ACCOUNT1` is `"account1"`, the `retryCount2` and `ACCOUNT2` should also be `3` and `"account1"` respectively. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account2";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account2";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account2";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account2";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are related to each other. Since `retryCount1` is `null` and `ACCOUNT1` is `"account2"`, the `retryCount2` and `ACCOUNT2` should also be `null` and `"account2"` respectively. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account3";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account3";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account3";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account3";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are related to each other. Since `retryCount1` is `0` and `ACCOUNT1` is `"account3"`, the `retryCount2` and `ACCOUNT2` should also be `0` and `"account3"` respectively. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account4";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account4";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account4";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account4";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are related to each other. Since `retryCount1` is `5` and `ACCOUNT1` is `"account4"`, the `retryCount2` and `ACCOUNT2` should also be `5` and `"account4"` respectively. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account5";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account5";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account5";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account5";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` are related to each other. Since `retryCount1` is `-1` and `ACCOUNT1` is `"account5"`, the `retryCount2` and `ACCOUNT2` should also be `-1` and `"account5"` respectively. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE' pass.
