# New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "YYYY-hH", where YYYY is the year and HH is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 2020 and a half-of-year of 2, which corresponds to the text "2020-h2".

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1999-h1";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1999-h1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "YYYY-hH", where YYYY is the year and HH is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 1999 and a half-of-year of 1, which corresponds to the text "1999-h1".

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 3000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "3000-h2";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 3000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "3000-h2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "YYYY-hH", where YYYY is the year and HH is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 3000 and a half-of-year of 2, which corresponds to the text "3000-h2".

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "0000-h1";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "0000-h1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "YYYY-hH", where YYYY is the year and HH is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of 0 and a half-of-year of 1, which corresponds to the text "0000-h1".

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year = -1;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "-1-h2";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = -1;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "-1-h2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "YYYY-hH", where YYYY is the year and HH is the half-of-year. The new source input satisfies this relation by providing a year of -1 and a half-of-year of 2, which corresponds to the text "-1-h2".
