## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method under test `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` and `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` handle cases where `totalSegmentsInTier` is zero. The method returns the minimum number of segments to move, which is `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` in this case.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method under test `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` and `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` handle cases where `totalSegmentsInTier` is one. The method returns the minimum number of segments to move, which is `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` in this case.

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method under test `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` and `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` handle cases where `totalSegmentsInTier` is less than the minimum number of segments to move. The method returns the minimum number of segments to move, which is `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` in this case.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method under test `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` and `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` handle cases where `totalSegmentsInTier` is greater than the minimum number of segments to move. The method returns the minimum number of segments to move, which is `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` in this case.

## New input5:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method under test `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` and `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` handle cases where `totalSegmentsInTier` is the maximum value that can be stored in an integer. The method returns the minimum number of segments to move, which is `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` in this case.
