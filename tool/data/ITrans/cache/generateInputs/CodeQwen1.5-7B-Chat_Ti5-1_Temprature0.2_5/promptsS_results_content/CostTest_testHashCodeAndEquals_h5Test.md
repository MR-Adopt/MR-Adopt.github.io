## New input1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `hashCode()` method of the `Cost` class returns the value of the `value` field, which is an integer. Therefore, if the `value` field is set to 0, the `hashCode()` method will return 0, which is a valid hash code.

## New input2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `hashCode()` method of the `Cost` class returns the value of the `value` field, which is an integer. Therefore, if the `value` field is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the `hashCode()` method will return `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which is a valid hash code.

## New input3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `hashCode()` method of the `Cost` class returns the value of the `value` field, which is an integer. Therefore, if the `value` field is set to -1, the `hashCode()` method will return -1, which is a valid hash code.

## New input4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `hashCode()` method of the `Cost` class returns the value of the `value` field, which is an integer. Therefore, if the `value` field is set to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, the `hashCode()` method will return `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which is a valid hash code.

## New input5:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `hashCode()` method of the `Cost` class returns the value of the `value` field, which is an integer. Therefore, if the `value` field is set to 100, the `hashCode()` method will return 100, which is a valid hash code.
