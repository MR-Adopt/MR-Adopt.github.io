## New input1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("bar", TokenType.STRING);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the name of the field from "foo" to "bar". This change is different from the original test case, which uses "foo" as the name.

## New input2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.INT);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the type of the field from STRING to INT. This change is different from the original test case, which uses STRING as the type.

## New input3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it marks the field as deprecated. This change is different from the original test case, which marks the field as not deprecated.

## New input4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses an empty string as the name of the field. This change is different from the original test case, which uses "foo" as the name.

## New input5:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses null as the type of the field. This change is different from the original test case, which uses STRING as the type.
