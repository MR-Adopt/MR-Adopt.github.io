## New input1:
```java
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("12x", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it maintains the same key-value pairs as the original test case. It is a simple and straightforward test case that covers the basic functionality of the method under test.

## New input2:
```java
    v01.put("empty", "");
    v01.put("null", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a key-value pair with an empty string and a null value. It tests the method under test's ability to handle different types of values, including empty strings and null values.

## New input3:
```java
    v01.put("negative", -123);
    v01.put("positive", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a key-value pair with negative and positive integer values. It tests the method under test's ability to handle different integer values.

## New input4:
```java
    v01.put("large", 1234567890);
    v01.put("small", -123456789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a key-value pair with large and small integer values. It tests the method under test's ability to handle very large and very small integer values.

## New input5:
```java
    v01.put("special", "@#$%^&*()");
    v01.put("alphanumeric", "abc123");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a key-value pair with special characters and alphanumeric strings. It tests the method under test's ability to handle different types of strings.
