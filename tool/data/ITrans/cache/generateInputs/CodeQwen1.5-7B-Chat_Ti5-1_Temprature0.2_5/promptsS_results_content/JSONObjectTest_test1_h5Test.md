## New input1:
```java
    JSONObject v01 = JSONObject.of("name", "John Doe");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the JSONObject. The key is "name" and the value is "John Doe". This is a common use case for JSONObjects, as they are used to represent data in a key-value format.

## New input2:
```java
    JSONObject v01 = JSONObject.of("age", 30);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the JSONObject. The key is "age" and the value is 30. This is another common use case for JSONObjects, as they are used to represent data in a key-value format.

## New input3:
```java
    JSONObject v01 = JSONObject.of("city", "New York");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the JSONObject. The key is "city" and the value is "New York". This is another common use case for JSONObjects, as they are used to represent data in a key-value format.

## New input4:
```java
    JSONObject v01 = JSONObject.of("id", 1001, "name", "John Doe", "age", 30, "city", "New York");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds multiple key-value pairs to the JSONObject. The keys are "id", "name", "age", and "city", and the corresponding values are 1001, "John Doe", 30, and "New York". This is a more complex use case for JSONObjects, as they can represent a wide range of data structures.

## New input5:
```java
    JSONObject v01 = JSONObject.of("id", 1001, "name", "John Doe", "age", 30, "city", "New York", "address", "123 Main St");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the JSONObject. The key is "address" and the value is "123 Main St". This is another common use case for JSONObjects, as they are used to represent data in a key-value format.
