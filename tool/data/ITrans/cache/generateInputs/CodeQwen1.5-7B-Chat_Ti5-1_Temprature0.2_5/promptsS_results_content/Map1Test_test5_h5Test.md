## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1.5D);
    v01.put("102", 2.5D);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with double values. This is a common scenario when dealing with financial data or measurements that require decimal precision.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 0D);
    v01.put("102", 0D);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with zero values. This is a common scenario when dealing with zero-based data or scenarios where the absence of a value is meaningful.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", -1D);
    v01.put("102", -2D);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with negative double values. This is a common scenario when dealing with financial data or scenarios where negative values have specific meanings.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", Double.MAX_VALUE);
    v01.put("102", Double.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with the maximum and minimum double values. This is a common scenario when dealing with scenarios where extreme values are meaningful or necessary.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", Double.NaN);
    v01.put("102", Double.NaN);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with Not-a-Number (NaN) double values. This is a common scenario when dealing with scenarios where NaN values are meaningful or necessary.
