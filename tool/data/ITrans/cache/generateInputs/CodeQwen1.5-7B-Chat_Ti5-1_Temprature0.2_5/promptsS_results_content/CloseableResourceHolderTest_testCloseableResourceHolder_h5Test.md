## New input1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
```
Explanation: This input creates a lambda expression that does nothing when closed. This is a valid input because it does not interact with any external resources or state, and it does not throw any exceptions when closed.

## New input2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = System.out::close;
```
Explanation: This input creates a method reference to the `close` method of `System.out`, which is a valid input because it is a resource that can be closed.

## New input3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input creates a custom `Closeable` implementation that throws an `IOException` when closed. This is a valid input because it demonstrates the ability to handle exceptions when closing a resource.

## New input4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input creates a custom `Closeable` implementation that does nothing when closed. This is a valid input because it demonstrates the ability to handle no-op operations when closing a resource.

## New input5:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input creates a custom `Closeable` implementation that does nothing when closed. This is a valid input because it demonstrates the ability to handle no-op operations when closing a resource.
