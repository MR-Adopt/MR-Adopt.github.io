## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows for a pool size of 0, which means that no resources will be pooled. This can be useful in scenarios where resources are not needed or when the pool size is determined dynamically.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows for a pool size of 1, which means that only one resource will be pooled. This can be useful in scenarios where resources are expensive to create or where the pool size is determined dynamically.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows for a pool size of 10, which means that ten resources will be pooled. This can be useful in scenarios where resources are expensive to create or where the pool size is determined dynamically.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(100);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows for a pool size of 100, which means that one hundred resources will be pooled. This can be useful in scenarios where resources are expensive to create or where the pool size is determined dynamically.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1000);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows for a pool size of 1000, which means that one thousand resources will be pooled. This can be useful in scenarios where resources are expensive to create or where the pool size is determined dynamically.
