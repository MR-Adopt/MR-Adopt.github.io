## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: The `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string parameter `deviceBus` which represents the I2C bus number. In the original test case, the value is set to "1". However, the method's documentation specifies that the range for `deviceBus` is "0" - "7". Therefore, setting `deviceBus` to "0" is a valid input that explores the lower boundary of the valid range.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: Similar to the explanation for input1, setting `deviceBus` to "7" is a valid input that explores the upper boundary of the valid range.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
```
Explanation: Setting `deviceBus` to "3" is a valid input that explores the middle of the valid range.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "2";
```
Explanation: Setting `deviceBus` to "2" is a valid input that explores a different value within the valid range.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
```
Explanation: Setting `deviceBus` to "8" is an invalid input that falls outside the valid range specified by the method's documentation. This input is used to test the method's behavior when an invalid input is provided.
