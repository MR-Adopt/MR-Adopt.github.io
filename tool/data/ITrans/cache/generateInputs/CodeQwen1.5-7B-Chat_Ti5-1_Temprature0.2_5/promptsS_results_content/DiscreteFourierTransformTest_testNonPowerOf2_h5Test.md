## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(8, 1, Uniform.of(-10, 20));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(8);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 8x1 matrix with random double values between -10 and 20. This is a common scenario for Fourier transforms and should not cause any errors.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(16, 1, Uniform.of(-100, 200));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(16);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 16x1 matrix with random double values between -100 and 200. This is a larger scenario for Fourier transforms and should not cause any errors.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(32, 1, Uniform.of(-1000, 2000));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(32);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 32x1 matrix with random double values between -1000 and 2000. This is a very large scenario for Fourier transforms and should not cause any errors.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(64, 1, Uniform.of(-10000, 20000));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(64);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 64x1 matrix with random double values between -10000 and 20000. This is an extremely large scenario for Fourier transforms and should not cause any errors.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(128, 1, Uniform.of(-100000, 200000));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(128);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 128x1 matrix with random double values between -100000 and 200000. This is an extremely large scenario for Fourier transforms and should not cause any errors.
