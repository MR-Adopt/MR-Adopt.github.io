## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets `retryCount1` to 0, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will result in a new client being created and stored in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets `retryCount1` to 1, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will result in a new client being created and stored in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets `retryCount1` to 5, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will result in a new client being created and stored in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets `retryCount1` to 10, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will result in a new client being created and stored in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "anotherAccount";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets `retryCount1` to `null`, which is a valid value for the `retryCount` parameter in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. This will result in a new client being created and stored in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map.
