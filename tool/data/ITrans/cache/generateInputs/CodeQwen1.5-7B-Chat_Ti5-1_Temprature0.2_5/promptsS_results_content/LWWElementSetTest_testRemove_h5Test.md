## New input1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with a different key ("key2") and a different value (2). This ensures that the element being added and removed are not the same, and that the method under test is correctly handling the removal of elements.

## New input2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with the same key ("key1") but a different value (3). This ensures that the method under test is correctly handling the removal of elements with the same key but different values.

## New input3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias + 1);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with the same key ("key1") and the same value (1), but with a different bias (bias + 1). This ensures that the method under test is correctly handling the removal of elements with the same key and value but different biases.

## New input4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias - 1);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with the same key ("key1") and the same value (1), but with a different bias (bias - 1). This ensures that the method under test is correctly handling the removal of elements with the same key and value but different biases.

## New input5:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with the same key ("key1") and a different value (0). This ensures that the method under test is correctly handling the removal of elements with the same key but different values.
