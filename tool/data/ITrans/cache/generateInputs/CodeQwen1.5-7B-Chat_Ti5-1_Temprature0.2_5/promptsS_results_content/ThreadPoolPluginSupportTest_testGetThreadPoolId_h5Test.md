## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor1 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test1", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test1"), a different core pool size (10), and a different maximum pool size (10). It also has a different keep-alive time (2000L) and a different time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS). The queue size is also different (2), and the thread factory and rejection policy are the same as the original executor.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor2 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test2", manager, 0, 0, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(0), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test2"), a core pool size of 0, and a maximum pool size of 0. It has a keep-alive time of 0L and a time unit of TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS. The queue size is also 0, and the thread factory is the same as the original executor. The rejection policy is set to CallerRunsPolicy.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor3 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test3", manager, 5, 10, 500L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test3"), a different core pool size (5), and a different maximum pool size (10). It has a keep-alive time of 500L and a time unit of TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS. The queue size is a LinkedBlockingQueue, and the thread factory is the same as the original executor. The rejection policy is set to DiscardPolicy.

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor4 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test4", manager, 1, 1, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test4"), a different core pool size (1), and a different maximum pool size (1). It has a keep-alive time of 1000L and a time unit of TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS. The queue size is a SynchronousQueue, and the thread factory is the same as the original executor. The rejection policy is set to AbortPolicy.

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor5 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test5", manager, 3, 5, 300L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new PriorityBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.RejectedExecutionHandler() {
    @Override
    public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor executor) {
        executor.execute(r);
    }
});
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test5"), a different core pool size (3), and a different maximum pool size (5). It has a keep-alive time of 300L and a time unit of TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS. The queue size is a PriorityBlockingQueue, and the thread factory is the same as the original executor. The rejection policy is a custom handler that simply re-executes the rejected task using the same executor.
