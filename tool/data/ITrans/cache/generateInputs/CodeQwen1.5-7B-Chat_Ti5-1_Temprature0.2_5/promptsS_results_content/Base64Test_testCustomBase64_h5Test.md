## New input1:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "Hello World".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a common string that is used for testing purposes. It is a simple string that contains the characters "Hello World" and is encoded in UTF-8 format. This input will cover the basic functionality of the base64 encoding and decoding methods.

## New input2:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "1234567890".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains only numeric characters. Numeric characters are a common set of characters that are used in base64 encoding. This input will cover the functionality of the base64 encoding and decoding methods when dealing with numeric data.

## New input3:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "!@#$%^&*()".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains special characters. Special characters are a common set of characters that are used in base64 encoding. This input will cover the functionality of the base64 encoding and decoding methods when dealing with special characters.

## New input4:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is an empty string. An empty string is a special case that should be handled correctly by the base64 encoding and decoding methods. This input will cover the functionality of the base64 encoding and decoding methods when dealing with empty strings.

## New input5:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "a".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains only one character. This input will cover the functionality of the base64 encoding and decoding methods when dealing with single characters.
