## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates a `FilterEvent` with a unique event name, type, and description. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method will return a non-empty array of events when called.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", null, "Description2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates a `FilterEvent` with a unique event name and a null type. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method will return a non-empty array of events when called, as the null type will not be excluded from the result.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", null);
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates a `FilterEvent` with a unique event name and a null description. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method will return a non-empty array of events when called, as the null description will not be excluded from the result.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This input creates a `FilterEvent` and adds it to the `Filter` twice. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method will return a non-empty array of events when called, as there are multiple events in the `Filter`.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.remove(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This input creates a `FilterEvent` and adds it to the `Filter`, then removes it. This ensures that the `getNewEvents` method will return an empty array of events when called, as the removed event is no longer in the `Filter`.
