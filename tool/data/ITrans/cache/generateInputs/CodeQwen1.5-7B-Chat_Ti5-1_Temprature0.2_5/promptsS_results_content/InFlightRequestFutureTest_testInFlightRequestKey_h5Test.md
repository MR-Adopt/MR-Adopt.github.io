## New input1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value of `partition` from 0 to 1, which is a different scenario from the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value of `offset` from 0 to 1, which is a different scenario from the original test case.

## New input3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it remains the same as the original test case, which is a valid scenario.

## New input4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it remains the same as the original test case, which is a valid scenario.

## New input5:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it remains the same as the original test case, which is a valid scenario.
