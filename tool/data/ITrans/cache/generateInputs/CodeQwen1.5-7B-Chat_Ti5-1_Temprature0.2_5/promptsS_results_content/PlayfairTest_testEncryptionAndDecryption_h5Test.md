## New input1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLOWORLD";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword ("SECRET") and a longer plaintext ("HELLOWORLD") than the original test case. The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original to ensure that the encryption and decryption process is tested with a different set of inputs.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAMMING";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a shorter keyword ("JAVA") and a longer plaintext ("PROGRAMMING") than the original test case. The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original to ensure that the encryption and decryption process is tested with a different set of inputs.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ENCRYPTION");
    String plaintext = "TESTCASE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword ("ENCRYPTION") and a shorter plaintext ("TESTCASE") than the original test case. The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original to ensure that the encryption and decryption process is tested with a different set of inputs.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("CIPHER");
    String plaintext = "MESSAGE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword ("CIPHER") and a shorter plaintext ("MESSAGE") than the original test case. The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be different from the original to ensure that the encryption and decryption process is tested with a different set of inputs.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("PLAYFAIR");
    String plaintext = "PLAYFAIR";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses the same keyword and plaintext as the original test case. The keyword and plaintext are chosen to be the same to ensure that the encryption and decryption process is tested with the same inputs.
