## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "456" and the value is 456. This ensures that the map has a different structure than the original input.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123". The new value is 456, which is different from the original value of 123. This ensures that the map has a different structure than the original input.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("456", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The new key is "456" and the value is 456. This ensures that the map has a different structure than the original input.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("456", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "456". The new value is 789, which is different from the original value of 456. This ensures that the map has a different structure than the original input.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("456", 456);
    v01.put("789", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The new key is "789" and the value is 789. This ensures that the map has a different structure than the original input.
