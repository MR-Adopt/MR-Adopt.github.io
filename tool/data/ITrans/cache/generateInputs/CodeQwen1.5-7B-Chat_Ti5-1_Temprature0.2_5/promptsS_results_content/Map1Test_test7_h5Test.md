## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(0));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(0));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are 0. This is a common scenario where the values are not significant and can be set to 0.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MAX_VALUE));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are the maximum and minimum values that can be represented by a `long` data type. This is a common scenario where the values are extreme and can be set to their maximum or minimum values.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(1));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(-1));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are 1 and -1, respectively. This is a common scenario where the values are positive and negative, and can be set to 1 and -1.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(100));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(200));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are 100 and 200, respectively. This is a common scenario where the values are positive and negative, and can be set to any positive or negative values.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MIN_VALUE));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are the maximum and minimum values that can be represented by an `int` data type. This is a common scenario where the values are extreme and can be set to their maximum or minimum values.
