## New input1:
```java
Element element1 = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key1", a timestamp of 1, and the bias value. This is a common and valid scenario for adding elements to a set.

## New input2:
```java
Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key2", a timestamp of 2, and the bias value. This is another common and valid scenario for adding elements to a set.

## New input3:
```java
Element element3 = new Element("key3", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key3", a timestamp of 3, and the bias value. This is yet another common and valid scenario for adding elements to a set.

## New input4:
```java
Element element4 = new Element("key4", 4, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key4", a timestamp of 4, and the bias value. This is a different timestamp from the previous elements, and it is another common and valid scenario for adding elements to a set.

## New input5:
```java
Element element5 = new Element("key5", 5, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key5", a timestamp of 5, and the bias value. This is yet another different timestamp from the previous elements, and it is another common and valid scenario for adding elements to a set.
