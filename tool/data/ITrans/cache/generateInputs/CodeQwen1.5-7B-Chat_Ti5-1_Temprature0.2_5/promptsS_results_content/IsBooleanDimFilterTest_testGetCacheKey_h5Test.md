## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the attribute name from "x" to "y". This change should not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only deals with the attribute name and not the value.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the column type from STRING to INTEGER. This change should not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only deals with the column type and not the value.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value from "hello" to "world". This change should not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only deals with the value and not the attribute name.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the filter context from null to "world". This change should not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only deals with the filter context and not the value.

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value from "hello" to an empty string. This change should not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only deals with the value and not the attribute name.
