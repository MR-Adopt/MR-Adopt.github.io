## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, BigDecimal> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigDecimal.valueOf(101));
    v01.put("102", BigDecimal.valueOf(102));
    v01.put("103", BigDecimal.valueOf(103));
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional key-value pair ("103", BigDecimal.valueOf(103)) in the map. This ensures that the map has a different size than the original map, which could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, BigDecimal> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigDecimal.valueOf(101));
    v01.put("102", BigDecimal.valueOf(102));
    v01.put("101", BigDecimal.valueOf(103));
```
Explanation: This input has the same keys as the original map, but the value associated with the key "101" has been changed to BigDecimal.valueOf(103). This could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test if it relies on the values associated with the keys.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, BigDecimal> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigDecimal.valueOf(101));
    v01.put("102", BigDecimal.valueOf(102));
    v01.put("103", BigDecimal.valueOf(101));
```
Explanation: This input has the same values as the original map, but the key associated with the value BigDecimal.valueOf(101) has been changed to "103". This could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test if it relies on the keys associated with the values.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, BigDecimal> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigDecimal.valueOf(101));
    v01.put("102", BigDecimal.valueOf(102));
    v01.put("", BigDecimal.valueOf(101));
```
Explanation: This input includes an empty string as a key in the map. This could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test if it relies on the keys being non-empty.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, BigDecimal> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigDecimal.valueOf(101));
    v01.put("102", BigDecimal.valueOf(102));
    v01.put("null", BigDecimal.valueOf(101));
```
Explanation: This input includes the string "null" as a key in the map. This could potentially affect the behavior of the method under test if it relies on the keys being non-null.
