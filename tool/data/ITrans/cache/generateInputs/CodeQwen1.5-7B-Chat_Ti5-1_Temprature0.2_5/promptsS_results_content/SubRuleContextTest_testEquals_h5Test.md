## New input1:
```java
    String NAME = "name1";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the `NAME` value from "name" to "name1". This will result in a different `SubRuleContext` object being generated, as the `NAME` is used as a key in the `nameToIds` map.

## New input2:
```java
    String NAME = "name2";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the `NAME` value from "name" to "name2". This will result in a different `SubRuleContext` object being generated, as the `NAME` is used as a key in the `nameToIds` map.

## New input3:
```java
    String NAME = "name3";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the `NAME` value from "name" to "name3". This will result in a different `SubRuleContext` object being generated, as the `NAME` is used as a key in the `nameToIds` map.

## New input4:
```java
    String NAME = "";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the `NAME` value from "name" to "". This will result in a different `SubRuleContext` object being generated, as the `NAME` is used as a key in the `nameToIds` map.

## New input5:
```java
    String NAME = null;
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the `NAME` value from "name" to null. This will result in a different `SubRuleContext` object being generated, as the `NAME` is used as a key in the `nameToIds` map.
