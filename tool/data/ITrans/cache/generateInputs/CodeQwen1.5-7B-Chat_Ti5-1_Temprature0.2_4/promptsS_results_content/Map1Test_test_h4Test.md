## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key "456" and the value "def" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123". The value "def" is a string, which is a valid entry in a HashMap.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the value is null. Null values are also valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("", "abc");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is an empty string. Empty strings are valid keys in a HashMap.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "abc");
    v01.put("456", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two new key-value pairs to the map. The keys "123" and "456" are both strings, and the values "abc" and "def" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.
