## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value of the string "hello" to "world". This will result in a different cache key, as the cache key is based on the filter's properties, including the value.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the column name from "x" to "y". This will result in a different cache key, as the cache key is based on the filter's properties, including the column name.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the column type from STRING to INTEGER. This will result in a different cache key, as the cache key is based on the filter's properties, including the column type.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, null, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value to null. This will result in a different cache key, as the cache key is based on the filter's properties, including the value.

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the filter to include a secondary dimension. This will result in a different cache key, as the cache key is based on the filter's properties, including the secondary dimension.
