## New input1:
```java
    StartupListener startUpListener1 = mock(StartupListener.class);
```
Explanation: This input is a valid mock object of the `StartupListener` interface. It is a common practice in unit testing to mock dependencies of the class under test. This mock object can be used to verify that the method under test calls the expected methods on the mock object.

## New input2:
```java
    StartupListener startUpListener1 = new StartupListener() {
        @Override
        public void onStartup() {
            // do nothing
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input is a valid implementation of the `StartupListener` interface. It is a lambda expression that defines an anonymous class that implements the `StartupListener` interface. This implementation does not perform any action when the `onStartup` method is called. This input is a boundary case because it does not perform any action when the `onStartup` method is called, which may not be the expected behavior of the method under test.

## New input3:
```java
    StartupListener startUpListener1 = new StartupListener() {
        @Override
        public void onStartup() {
            throw new RuntimeException("onStartup method called");
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input is a valid implementation of the `StartupListener` interface. It is a lambda expression that defines an anonymous class that implements the `StartupListener` interface. This implementation throws a `RuntimeException` when the `onStartup` method is called. This input is a boundary case because it throws an exception when the `onStartup` method is called, which may not be the expected behavior of the method under test.

## New input4:
```java
    StartupListener startUpListener1 = null;
```
Explanation: This input is a valid null value. It is a boundary case because it is not a valid object of the `StartupListener` interface. This input is used to verify that the method under test handles null input gracefully.

## New input5:
```java
    StartupListener startUpListener1 = new StartupListener() {
        @Override
        public void onStartup() {
            // do nothing
        }
    };
    startUpListener1.onStartup();
```
Explanation: This input is a valid implementation of the `StartupListener` interface that calls the `onStartup` method. It is a boundary case because it calls the `onStartup` method, which may not be the expected behavior of the method under test.
