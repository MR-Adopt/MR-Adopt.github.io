## New input1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Closeable` object that does nothing when closed. This is a valid input because it does not violate the contract of the `Closeable` interface, which requires that the `close()` method does not throw any exceptions.

## New input2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = System.out::close;
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Closeable` object that closes the standard output stream. This is a valid input because it does not violate the contract of the `Closeable` interface, which requires that the `close()` method does not throw any exceptions.

## New input3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Closeable` object that throws an `IOException` when closed. This is a valid input because it does not violate the contract of the `Closeable` interface, which requires that the `close()` method does not throw any exceptions.

## New input4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Closeable` object that does nothing when closed. This is a valid input because it does not violate the contract of the `Closeable` interface, which requires that the `close()` method does not throw any exceptions.

## New input5:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new RuntimeException("Test exception");
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Closeable` object that throws a `RuntimeException` when closed. This is a valid input because it does not violate the contract of the `Closeable` interface, which requires that the `close()` method does not throw any exceptions.
