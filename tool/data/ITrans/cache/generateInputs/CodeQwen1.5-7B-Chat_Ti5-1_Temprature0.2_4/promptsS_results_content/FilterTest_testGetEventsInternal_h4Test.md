## New input1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event 2");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `Filter` object with two `FilterEventMock` objects, each with a unique name. The `FilterEventMock` class is a mock implementation of the `FilterEvent` interface, and the names are chosen to be unique. This ensures that the `events` list in the `Filter` object is not a reference to the original list, but rather a copy of the original list.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = mockEvent1;
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `Filter` object with two references to the same `FilterEventMock` object. The `FilterEventMock` class is a mock implementation of the `FilterEvent` interface, and the name is chosen to be "Event 1". This ensures that the `events` list in the `Filter` object is not a reference to the original list, but rather a copy of the original list.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `Filter` object with two `FilterEventMock` objects with the same name. The `FilterEventMock` class is a mock implementation of the `FilterEvent` interface, and the name is chosen to be "Event 1". This ensures that the `events` list in the `Filter` object is not a reference to the original list, but rather a copy of the original list.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event 2");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `Filter` object with three `FilterEventMock` objects, two of which have the same name. The `FilterEventMock` class is a mock implementation of the `FilterEvent` interface, and the names are chosen to be "Event 1" and "Event 2". This ensures that the `events` list in the `Filter` object is not a reference to the original list, but rather a copy of the original list.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event 2");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.remove(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `Filter` object with two `FilterEventMock` objects, removes one of them, and then adds it back. The `FilterEventMock` class is a mock implementation of the `FilterEvent` interface, and the names are chosen to be "Event 1" and "Event 2". This ensures that the `events` list in the `Filter` object is not a reference to the original list, but rather a copy of the original list.
