## New input1:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `true`. This means that the `extractValues` method should trim the array to the size of the actual data before returning it. Since the original test case appends three zeros to the list, the expected output should be an array of length 3. Therefore, this input is valid and boundary-case because it tests the method's ability to handle trimming when the input array is not already trimmed.

## New input2:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = false;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `false`. This means that the `extractValues` method should return the entire array, including any trailing zeros. Since the original test case appends three zeros to the list, the expected output should be an array of length 6. Therefore, this input is valid and boundary-case because it tests the method's ability to handle the case when the input array is not trimmed.

## New input3:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `true`. This means that the `extractValues` method should trim the array to the size of the actual data before returning it. Since the original test case appends three zeros to the list, the expected output should be an array of length 3. Therefore, this input is valid and boundary-case because it tests the method's ability to handle trimming when the input array is already trimmed.

## New input4:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = false;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `false`. This means that the `extractValues` method should return the entire array, including any trailing zeros. Since the original test case appends three zeros to the list, the expected output should be an array of length 6. Therefore, this input is valid and boundary-case because it tests the method's ability to handle the case when the input array is already trimmed.

## New input5:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `true`. This means that the `extractValues` method should trim the array to the size of the actual data before returning it. Since the original test case appends three zeros to the list, the expected output should be an array of length 3. Therefore, this input is valid and boundary-case because it tests the method's ability to handle trimming when the input array is empty.
