## New input1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value of 0, which is a valid and boundary-case value.

## New input2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value equal to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which is the maximum possible value for an integer in Java.

## New input3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a negative value, which is a valid and boundary-case value.

## New input4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value of 100, which is a valid and boundary-case value.

## New input5:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a `Cost` object with a value equal to `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which is the minimum possible value for an integer in Java.
