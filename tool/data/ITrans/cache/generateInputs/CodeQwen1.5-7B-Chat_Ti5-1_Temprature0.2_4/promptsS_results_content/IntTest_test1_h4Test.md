## New input1:
```java
    Integer v01 = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the smallest possible integer value, which is 0. This ensures that the method under test handles edge cases properly.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer v01 = 2147483647;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the maximum possible integer value, which is 2147483647. This ensures that the method under test handles edge cases properly.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer v01 = -2147483648;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the minimum possible integer value, which is -2147483648. This ensures that the method under test handles edge cases properly.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer v01 = null;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a null value, which is a possible input for the method under test. This ensures that the method under test handles null values properly.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer v01 = 1000000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a typical integer value, which is 1000000. This ensures that the method under test handles typical values properly.
