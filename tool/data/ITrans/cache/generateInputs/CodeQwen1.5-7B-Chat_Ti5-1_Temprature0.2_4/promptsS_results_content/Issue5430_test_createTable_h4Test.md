## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it removes the unnecessary whitespace and commas between the table name and the column definitions. It also removes the extra space before the STORED keyword.

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE\n";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a newline character at the end of the SQL statement. This is a common practice to ensure that the SQL statement is properly formatted and easy to read.

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE;";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a semicolon at the end of the SQL statement. This is a common practice to terminate SQL statements in many programming languages.

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE\n" + "PARTITIONED BY (c int)";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a partitioned by clause to the SQL statement. This is a common practice in SQL to divide the data into partitions based on certain criteria.

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE\n" + "PARTITIONED BY (c int)\n" + "LIFECYCLE 30";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a lifecycle clause to the SQL statement. This is a common practice in SQL to automatically drop old partitions after a certain period of time.
