## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because the device address "0x78" is outside the valid range of "0x70" to "0x77". This could potentially cause issues with the I2C communication if the device is not connected to the correct address.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because the device address "0x6F" is outside the valid range of "0x70" to "0x77". This could potentially cause issues with the I2C communication if the device is not connected to the correct address.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x70";
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because the device address "0x70" is the default address for the I2cMux device. This input tests the method's ability to handle the default value.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x77";
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because the device address "0x77" is the maximum valid address for the I2cMux device. This input tests the method's ability to handle the maximum valid value.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because the device address "0x00" is the minimum valid address for the I2cMux device. This input tests the method's ability to handle the minimum valid value.
