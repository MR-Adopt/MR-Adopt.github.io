## New input1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setSkin` method allows setting the skin to `null`, and the `hashCode` method should return `0` when the skin is `null`.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin2"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setSkin` method allows setting the skin to a new URL, and the `hashCode` method should return the same hash code for two objects with the same skin URL.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", "value");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setProperty` method allows setting a new `ProfileProperty`, and the `hashCode` method should return the same hash code for two objects with the same `ProfileProperty`.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", "value");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setProperty` method allows setting a new `ProfileProperty` and then setting it to `null`, and the `hashCode` method should return the same hash code for two objects with the same `ProfileProperty` and then setting it to `null`.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", "value");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setSkin` method allows setting the skin to the same URL multiple times, and the `hashCode` method should return the same hash code for two objects with the same skin URL and the same `ProfileProperty`.
