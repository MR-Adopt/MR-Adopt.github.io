## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` object with a unique event name, type, and description. This ensures that the event is different from the original mock event and that the filter can process it.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock(null, "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` object with a null event name. This ensures that the event name is not set, which could be a valid scenario for the filter.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", null, "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` object with a null event type. This ensures that the event type is not set, which could be a valid scenario for the filter.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", null);
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` object with a null event description. This ensures that the event description is not set, which could be a valid scenario for the filter.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "Type2", "Description2");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a second `FilterEvent` object and adds it to the filter. This ensures that the filter can process multiple events.
