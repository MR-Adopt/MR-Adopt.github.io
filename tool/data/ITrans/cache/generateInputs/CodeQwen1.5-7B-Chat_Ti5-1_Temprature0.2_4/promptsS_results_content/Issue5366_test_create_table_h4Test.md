## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is the original test case provided. It creates a table partition for the "orders" table with a modulus of 4 and a remainder of 3.

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 5, REMAINDER 2);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus to 5 and the remainder to 2. It still creates a table partition for the "orders" table.

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 3, REMAINDER 1);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus to 3 and the remainder to 1. It still creates a table partition for the "orders" table.

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 6, REMAINDER 0);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus to 6 and the remainder to 0. It still creates a table partition for the "orders" table.

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 7, REMAINDER 3);";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the modulus to 7 and the remainder to 3. It still creates a table partition for the "orders" table.
