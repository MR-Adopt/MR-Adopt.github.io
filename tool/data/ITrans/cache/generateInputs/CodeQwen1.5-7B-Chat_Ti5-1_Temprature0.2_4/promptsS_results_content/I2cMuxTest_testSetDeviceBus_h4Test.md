## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string input for the I2C bus number, and the range of valid bus numbers is "0" to "7". The value "0" is a valid boundary case, as it represents the lowest possible I2C bus number.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string input for the I2C bus number, and the range of valid bus numbers is "0" to "7". The value "7" is a valid boundary case, as it represents the highest possible I2C bus number.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string input for the I2C bus number, and the range of valid bus numbers is "0" to "7". The value "3" is a valid middle case, as it represents a valid I2C bus number in the middle of the valid range.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string input for the I2C bus number, and the range of valid bus numbers is "0" to "7". The value "8" is outside the valid range, and attempting to set the bus number to "8" would result in an error or unexpected behavior.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `setDeviceBus` method accepts a string input for the I2C bus number, and an empty string is not a valid input. An empty string would result in an error or unexpected behavior when attempting to set the bus number.
