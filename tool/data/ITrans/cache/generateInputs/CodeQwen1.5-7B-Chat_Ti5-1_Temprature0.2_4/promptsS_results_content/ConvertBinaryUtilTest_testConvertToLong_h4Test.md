## New input1:
```java
    String randomString = "0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a single digit string that can be converted to a long integer. It is also a boundary case because it is the smallest possible long integer value.

## New input2:
```java
    String randomString = "9223372036854775807";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is the maximum possible long integer value. It is also a boundary case because it is the largest possible long integer value.

## New input3:
```java
    String randomString = "-9223372036854775808";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is the minimum possible long integer value. It is also a boundary case because it is the smallest possible long integer value.

## New input4:
```java
    String randomString = "12345678901234567890";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a string that can be converted to a long integer. However, it is not a boundary case because it is not the smallest or largest possible long integer value.

## New input5:
```java
    String randomString = "randomString1234567890";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a string that can be converted to a long integer. However, it is not a boundary case because it is not the smallest or largest possible long integer value.
