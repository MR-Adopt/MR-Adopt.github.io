## New input1:
```java
    Class input = Integer.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it is the most basic case of using the `Integer` class as the input for the `listOf` method. It demonstrates the simplest usage of the method.

## New input2:
```java
    Class input = String.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses a different class `String` as the input for the `listOf` method. It tests the method with a different type of object.

## New input3:
```java
    Class input = List.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses the `List` class itself as the input for the `listOf` method. It tests the method with a raw type.

## New input4:
```java
    Class input = new ArrayList<Integer>().getClass();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses an anonymous subclass of `ArrayList` as the input for the `listOf` method. It tests the method with a subclass of `List`.

## New input5:
```java
    Class input = null;
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses `null` as the input for the `normalize` method. It tests the method with a null value.
