## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input includes two key-value pairs, where both keys and values are valid strings and long integers respectively. This ensures that the map contains multiple entries and is not empty.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", null);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input includes a key-value pair where the key is valid and the value is null. This ensures that the map contains a null value and is not empty.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input includes a key-value pair where the key is an empty string and the value is valid. This ensures that the map contains a key with an empty string and is not empty.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("123", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input includes a key-value pair where the key is the same as an existing key in the map and the value is different. This ensures that the map contains duplicate keys and is not empty.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("123", null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a key-value pair where the key is the same as an existing key in the map and the value is null. This ensures that the map contains a key with a null value and is not empty.
