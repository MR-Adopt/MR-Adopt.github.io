## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("103", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional key-value pair ("103", 3F) in the map. This ensures that the map has a different size than the original map, which could be a valid scenario for the method under test.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("101", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input modifies the value associated with the key "101" from 1F to 3F. This could be a valid scenario for the method under test, as it changes the behavior of the method by altering the output.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("103", null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a key-value pair with a null value ("103", null). This could be a valid scenario for the method under test, as it handles null values appropriately.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes a key-value pair with an empty string as the key ("", 3F). This could be a valid scenario for the method under test, as it handles empty strings as valid keys.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("101", null);
```
Explanation: This input modifies the value associated with the key "101" from 1F to null. This could be a valid scenario for the method under test, as it handles null values appropriately.
