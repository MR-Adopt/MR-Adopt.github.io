## New input1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000000");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents the earliest possible time in the day, which is 00:00:00.000000000. The JsonWriter is initialized with a buffer size of 20, which is sufficient for this input. The LocalTime array is filled with the earliest possible time, which is repeated twice.

## New input2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents the latest possible time in the day, which is 23:59:59.999999999. The JsonWriter is initialized with a buffer size of 20, which is sufficient for this input. The LocalTime array is filled with the latest possible time, which is repeated twice.

## New input3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[0];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents an empty array of LocalTime objects. The JsonWriter is initialized with a buffer size of 20, which is sufficient for this input. The LocalTime array is filled with the same LocalTime object, which is repeated zero times.

## New input4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[1];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents an array of LocalTime objects with only one element. The JsonWriter is initialized with a buffer size of 20, which is sufficient for this input. The LocalTime array is filled with the same LocalTime object, which is repeated once.

## New input5:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[100];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents an array of LocalTime objects with 100 elements. The JsonWriter is initialized with a buffer size of 20, which is sufficient for this input. The LocalTime array is filled with the same LocalTime object, which is repeated 100 times.
