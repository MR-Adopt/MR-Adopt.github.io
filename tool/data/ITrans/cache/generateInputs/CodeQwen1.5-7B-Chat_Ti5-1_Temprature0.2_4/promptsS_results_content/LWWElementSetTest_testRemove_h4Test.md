## New input1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the key is a string, and the value is an integer. The bias is also included in the element. This input tests the scenario where the key is a string and the value is zero.

## New input2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the key is a string, and the value is an integer. The bias is also included in the element. This input tests the scenario where the key is a string and the value is the maximum integer value.

## New input3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the key is a string, and the value is an integer. The bias is also included in the element. This input tests the scenario where the key is a string and the value is the minimum integer value.

## New input4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the key is a string, and the value is an integer. The bias is also included in the element. This input tests the scenario where the key is an empty string.

## New input5:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the key is a string, and the value is an integer. The bias is also included in the element. This input tests the scenario where the bias is null.
