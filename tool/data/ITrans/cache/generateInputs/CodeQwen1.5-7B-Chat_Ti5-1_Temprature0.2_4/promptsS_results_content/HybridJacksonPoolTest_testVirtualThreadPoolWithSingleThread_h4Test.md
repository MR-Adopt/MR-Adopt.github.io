## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows a pool size of 0, which means there will be no thread-local stacks and each thread will always get a new `BufferRecycler` instance. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge condition where the pool size is zero.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows a pool size of 1, which means there will be only one thread-local stack. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge condition where the pool size is one.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows a pool size of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which means there will be a maximum of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` thread-local stacks. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge condition where the pool size is the maximum possible value.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` does not allow a negative pool size. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge condition where the pool size is negative.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows a pool size of 2, which means there will be two thread-local stacks. This is a boundary case because it tests the edge condition where the pool size is two.
