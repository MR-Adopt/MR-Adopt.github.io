## New input1:
```java
Element element1 = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key1", a timestamp of 1, and the same bias as the original element. This is a common and valid scenario for adding an element to a set.

## New input2:
```java
Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key2", a timestamp of 2, and the same bias as the original element. This is another common and valid scenario for adding an element to a set.

## New input3:
```java
Element element3 = new Element("key3", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key3", a timestamp of 3, and the same bias as the original element. This is yet another common and valid scenario for adding an element to a set.

## New input4:
```java
Element element4 = new Element("key4", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key4", a timestamp of 0, and the same bias as the original element. This is a scenario where the timestamp is different from the original element, which could be valid in some cases.

## New input5:
```java
Element element5 = new Element("key5", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an element with the key "key5", a timestamp of 1, and the same bias as the original element. This is a scenario where the timestamp is the same as the original element, which could be valid in some cases.
