## New input1:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new FixedUuidGenerator(UUID.fromString("550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"));
```
Explanation: This input uses a `FixedUuidGenerator` with a predefined UUID value. This ensures that the `generateId()` method always returns the same UUID, which can be useful for testing scenarios where the behavior of the method does not depend on the actual UUID generated.

## New input2:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new SequentialUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a `SequentialUuidGenerator`, which generates UUIDs in a sequential order. This can be useful for testing scenarios where the order of the UUIDs is important, such as when testing the behavior of a system that requires a specific order of events.

## New input3:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new NullUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a `NullUuidGenerator`, which always returns `null` when the `generateId()` method is called. This can be useful for testing scenarios where the method should behave differently when the UUID is `null`, such as when testing the behavior of a system that requires a non-null UUID.

## New input4:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new EmptyUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses an `EmptyUuidGenerator`, which always returns an empty string when the `generateId()` method is called. This can be useful for testing scenarios where the method should behave differently when the UUID is an empty string, such as when testing the behavior of a system that requires a non-empty UUID.

## New input5:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new UuidGenerator() {
    @Override
    public UUID generateId() {
        return UUID.randomUUID();
    }
};
```
Explanation: This input uses a custom `UuidGenerator` implementation that always returns a new random UUID when the `generateId()` method is called. This can be useful for testing scenarios where the method should behave differently when the UUID is generated randomly, such as when testing the behavior of a system that requires a unique UUID for each event.
