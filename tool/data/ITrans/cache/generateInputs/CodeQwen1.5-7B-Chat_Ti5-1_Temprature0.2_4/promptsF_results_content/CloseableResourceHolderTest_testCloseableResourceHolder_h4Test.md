## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and the `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = System.out::close;
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and the `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and the `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and the `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new RuntimeException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and the `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`.
