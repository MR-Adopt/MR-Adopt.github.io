## New input pair0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: The new source input `element` is created with the same key and value as the original `element2`. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `remove` method should remove the element with the same key and value from the set.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: The new source input `element` is created with the same key and value as the original `element2`. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `remove` method should remove the element with the same key and value from the set.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: The new source input `element` is created with the same key and value as the original `element2`. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `remove` method should remove the element with the same key and value from the set.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("", 1, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: The new source input `element` is created with the same key and value as the original `element2`. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `remove` method should remove the element with the same key and value from the set.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```
Explanation: The new source input `element` is created with the same key and value as the original `element2`. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `remove` method should remove the element with the same key and value from the set.
