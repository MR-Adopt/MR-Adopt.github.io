## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1);
int year = 2020;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` input. For the new source input `date = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1)`, the month value is 1, so the `expected` value is calculated as `((1 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 1`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2021, 7, 1);
int year = 2021;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` input. For the new source input `date = LocalDate.of(2021, 7, 1)`, the month value is 7, so the `expected` value is calculated as `((7 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 2`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(1900, 12, 31);
int year = 1900;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` input. For the new source input `date = LocalDate.of(1900, 12, 31)`, the month value is 12, so the `expected` value is calculated as `((12 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 2`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2000, 2, 29);
int year = 2000;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` input. For the new source input `date = LocalDate.of(2000, 2, 29)`, the month value is 2, so the `expected` value is calculated as `((2 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 1`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2001;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2001, 2, 28);
int year = 2001;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` input. For the new source input `date = LocalDate.of(2001, 2, 28)`, the month value is 2, so the `expected` value is calculated as `((2 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 1`.
