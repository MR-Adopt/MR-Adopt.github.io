# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2025;
    int year3 = 2025;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2025;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getHalf().getValue();
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year and half of a `YearHalf` can be obtained by calling the `with` method on a `YearHalf` object with a `Year` object. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can use the `with` method to obtain a new `YearHalf` object with the same year and half as the original `YearHalf` object, but with the year changed to the value of `year2`. We can then use the `getYear` and `getHalf` methods to obtain the year and half of the new `YearHalf` object, which we can use as the values for `year3` and `half3`.

    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getYear();
