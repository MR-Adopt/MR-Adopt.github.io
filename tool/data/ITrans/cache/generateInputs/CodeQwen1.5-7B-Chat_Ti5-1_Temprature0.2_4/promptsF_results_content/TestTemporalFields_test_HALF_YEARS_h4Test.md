## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the year and quarter of the first year-quarter should be less than the year and quarter of the second year-quarter. In this case, the first year-quarter is (2023, 1) and the second year-quarter is (2023, 2). Since 2023 is less than 2024 and 1 is less than 2, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the year and quarter of the first year-quarter should be less than the year and quarter of the second year-quarter. In this case, the first year-quarter is (2023, 2) and the second year-quarter is (2023, 3). Since 2023 is less than 2024 and 2 is less than 3, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the year and quarter of the first year-quarter should be less than the year and quarter of the second year-quarter. In this case, the first year-quarter is (2023, 3) and the second year-quarter is (2023, 4). Since 2023 is less than 2024 and 3 is less than 4, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2024;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2024;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```

In this case, the first year-quarter is (2023, 4) and the second year-quarter is (2024, 1). Since 2023 is less than 2024 and 4 is less than 1, the new source input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
