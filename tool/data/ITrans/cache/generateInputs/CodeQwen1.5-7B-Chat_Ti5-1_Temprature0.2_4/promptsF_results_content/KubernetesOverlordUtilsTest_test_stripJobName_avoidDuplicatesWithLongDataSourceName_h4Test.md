## New input pair0:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
    String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_117_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
The inferred relation is that the job names generated from the task IDs should be different. The new source input `taskId1` is the same as the original source input `taskId1`, and the new follow-up input `taskId2` is a different task ID with the same data source name but a different timestamp. The assertions in the original test case will pass as the job names generated from the two task IDs are different.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z_extra_data";
    String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_117_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z_extra_data";
```
The inferred relation is that the job names generated from the task IDs should be different. The new source input `taskId1` is the same as the original source input `taskId1`, but with additional data appended to the task ID. The new follow-up input `taskId2` is the same as the original source input `taskId2`, but with additional data appended to the task ID. The assertions in the original test case will pass as the job names generated from the two task IDs are different.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z_extra_data_with_underscore";

```
The inferred relation is that the job names generated from the task IDs should be different. The new source input `taskId1` is the same as the original source input `taskId1`, but with additional data appended to the task ID, using underscores instead of spaces. The new follow-up input `taskId2` is the same as the original source input `taskId2`, but with additional data appended to the task ID, using underscores instead of spaces. The assertions in the original test case will pass as the job names generated from the two task IDs are different.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z_extra_data_with_dash";

```
The inferred relation is that the job names generated from the task IDs should be different. The new source input `taskId1` is the same as the original source input `taskId1`, but with additional data appended to the task ID, using dashes instead of spaces. The new follow-up input `taskId2` is the same as the original source input `taskId2`, but with additional data appended to the task ID, using dashes instead of spaces. The assertions in the original test case will pass as the job names generated from the two task IDs are different.

## New input pair4:
