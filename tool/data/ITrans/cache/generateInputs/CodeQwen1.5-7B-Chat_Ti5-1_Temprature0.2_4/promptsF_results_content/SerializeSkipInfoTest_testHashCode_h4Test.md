## New input pair0:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. Since the fieldName and fullClassName of both serializeSkipInfo and serializeSkipInfo2 are empty strings, their hashCodes should also be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. Since the fieldName and fullClassName of both serializeSkipInfo and serializeSkipInfo2 are the same, their hashCodes should also be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. Since the fieldName and fullClassName of both serializeSkipInfo and serializeSkipInfo2 are the same, their hashCodes should also be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName".repeat(1000));
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName".repeat(1000));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. Since the fieldName and fullClassName of both serializeSkipInfo and serializeSkipInfo2 are the same, their hashCodes should also be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2".repeat(1000));
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo2 = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2".repeat(1000));
    serializeSkipInfo2.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two SerializeSkipInfo objects is equal if their fieldName and fullClassName are equal. Since the fieldName and fullClassName of both serializeSkipInfo and serializeSkipInfo2 are the same, their hashCodes should also be equal.
