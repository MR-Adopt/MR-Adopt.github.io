For each new source input listed under 'NEW SOURCE INPUTS', please construct the corresponding follow-up input that satisfies your inferred relation and pass the assertions in the 'ORIGINAL TEST CASE'. Document the complete code for each new input pair in the format shown below:
## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be the same for both the source and follow-up inputs. This is because the `getBlobServiceClient` method is expected to return the same client for the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount`.

For the first new input pair, `retryCount1` is set to `5`, and `ACCOUNT1` is set to `"account"`. Since both the source and follow-up inputs have the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount`, the `getBlobServiceClient` method will return the same client for both inputs.

For the second new input pair, `retryCount1` is set to `0`, and `ACCOUNT1` is set to `"account"`. Since both the source and follow-up inputs have the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount`, the `getBlobServiceClient` method will return the same client for both inputs.

For the third new input pair, `retryCount1` is set to `-1`, and `ACCOUNT1` is set to `"account"`. Since both the source and follow-up inputs have the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount`, the `getBlobServiceClient` method will return the same client for both inputs.

For the fourth new input pair, `retryCount1` is set to `null`, and `ACCOUNT1` is set to `"newAccount"`. Since both the source and follow-up inputs have the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount`, the `getBlobServiceClient` method will return the same client for both inputs.

For the fifth new input pair, `retryCount1` is set to `null`, and `ACCOUNT1` is set to `""`. Since both the source and follow-up inputs have the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount`, the `getBlobServiceClient` method will return the same client for both inputs.
