## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "0.9";
    String v2 = "0.91";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. Since `0.9` is a lower version than `0.91`, we can infer that `0.91` is the follow-up input for `0.9`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. Since `1.0.0` is a lower version than `1.0.1`, we can infer that `1.0.1` is the follow-up input for `1.0.0`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.9.9";
    String v2 = "2.0.0";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. Since `1.9.9` is a lower version than `2.0.0`, we can infer that `2.0.0` is the follow-up input for `1.9.9`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.1";
    String v2 = "1.2.0";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. Since `1.1.1` is a lower version than `1.2.0`, we can infer that `1.2.0` is the follow-up input for `1.1.1`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0.0";
    String v2 = "2.0.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `v1` is a lower version than `v2`, then `v1` should be followed by a higher version number. Since `2.0.0` is a lower version than `2.0.1`, we can infer that `2.0.1` is the follow-up input for `2.0.0`.
