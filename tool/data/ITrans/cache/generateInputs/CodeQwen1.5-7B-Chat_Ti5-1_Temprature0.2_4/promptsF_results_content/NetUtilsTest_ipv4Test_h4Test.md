## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.1.1";
    long ipLong2 = 3232235777L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 string is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 string. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to convert the new source input "192.168.1.1" to its corresponding long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "255.255.255.255";
    long ipLong2 = 4294967295L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 string is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 string. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to convert the new source input "255.255.255.255" to its corresponding long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "0.0.0.0";
    long ipLong2 = 0L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 string is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 string. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to convert the new source input "0.0.0.0" to its corresponding long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 167772161L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 string is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 string. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to convert the new source input "10.0.0.1" to its corresponding long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 2886723584L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the long value obtained from the IPv4 string is equal to the long value obtained from the IPv4 string. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to convert the new source input "172.16.0.1" to its corresponding long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method.
