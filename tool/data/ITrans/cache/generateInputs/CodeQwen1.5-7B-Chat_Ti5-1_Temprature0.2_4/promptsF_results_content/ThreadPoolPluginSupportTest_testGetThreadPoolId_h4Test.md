# New input pair1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
The new source input is `executor` and the corresponding follow-up input is `support`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `getThreadPoolId()` method of the `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` class returns the thread-pool id, which is used to create a `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object. The `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object is then used to verify that the `getThreadPoolId()` method returns the same thread-pool id as the original `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object.

```
