## New input pair0:
```java
    String input = "A";
    String encoded2 = "QQ==";
```
Explanation: The new source input "A" is encoded into "QQ==" using the `encode` method of the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe` class. The `encode` method uses Java's built-in `Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString` method to encode the input string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The resulting string is then replaced with the character to avoid "=" to get the final encoded string "QQ==".

## New input pair1:
```java
    String input = "AB";
    String encoded2 = "QUJD";
```
Explanation: The new source input "AB" is encoded into "QUJD" using the `encode` method of the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe` class. The `encode` method uses Java's built-in `Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString` method to encode the input string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The resulting string is then replaced with the character to avoid "=" to get the final encoded string "QUJD".

## New input pair2:
```java
    String input = "ABC";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDRA==";
```
Explanation: The new source input "ABC" is encoded into "QUJDRA==" using the `encode` method of the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe` class. The `encode` method uses Java's built-in `Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString` method to encode the input string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The resulting string is then replaced with the character to avoid "=" to get the final encoded string "QUJDRA==".

## New input pair3:
```java
    String input = "ABCDE";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDREVG";
```
Explanation: The new source input "ABCDE" is encoded into "QUJDREVG" using the `encode` method of the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe` class. The `encode` method uses Java's built-in `Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString` method to encode the input string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The resulting string is then replaced with the character to avoid "=" to get the final encoded string "QUJDREVG".

## New input pair4:
```java
    String input = "ABCDEF";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDREVGQg==";
```
Explanation: The new source input "ABCDEF" is encoded into "QUJDREVGQg==" using the `encode` method of the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe` class. The `encode` method uses Java's built-in `Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString` method to encode the input string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The resulting string is then replaced with the character to avoid "=" to get the final encoded string "QUJDREVGQg==".
