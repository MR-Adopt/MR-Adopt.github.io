## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should satisfy the precondition in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' that checks if `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is greater than 0. Since `l` is 0, the precondition is not satisfied, and the follow-up input `l2` is set to -1 to satisfy the precondition. The `b` variable is set to false to indicate that intermediate super sorter storage is not enabled.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should satisfy the precondition in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' that checks if `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is greater than 0. Since `l` is -1, the precondition is not satisfied, and the follow-up input `l2` is set to -1 to satisfy the precondition. The `b` variable is set to false to indicate that intermediate super sorter storage is not enabled.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES - 1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    long l = MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES - 1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should satisfy the precondition in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' that checks if `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is greater than 0. Since `l` is equal to `MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES - 1`, the precondition is not satisfied, and the follow-up input `l2` is set to -1 to satisfy the precondition. The `b` variable is set to false to indicate that intermediate super sorter storage is not enabled.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES;
    long l2 = MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES;
    boolean b = true;
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    long l = MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES;
    long l2 = MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should satisfy the precondition in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' that checks if `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is greater than 0. Since `l` is equal to `MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES`, the precondition is satisfied, and the follow-up input `l2` is set to `MINIMUM_SUPER_SORTER_TMP_STORAGE_BYTES` to satisfy the precondition. The `b` variable is set to true to indicate that intermediate super sorter storage is enabled.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = true;
```
Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should satisfy the precondition in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' that checks if `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is greater than 0. Since `l` is equal to `Long.MAX_VALUE`, the precondition is satisfied, and the follow-up input `l2` is set to `Long.MAX_VALUE` to satisfy the precondition. The `b` variable is set to true to indicate that intermediate super sorter storage is enabled.
