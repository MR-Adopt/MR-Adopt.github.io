## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `totalSegmentsInTier` should be equal to the `minSegmentsToMove` calculated by the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method. Since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 10,000, the `minSegmentsToMove` should also be 10,000.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 30_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `totalSegmentsInTier` should be equal to the `minSegmentsToMove` calculated by the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method. Since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 30,000, the `minSegmentsToMove` should also be 30,000.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 15_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `totalSegmentsInTier` should be equal to the `minSegmentsToMove` calculated by the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method. Since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 15,000, the `minSegmentsToMove` should also be 15,000.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 25_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `totalSegmentsInTier` should be equal to the `minSegmentsToMove` calculated by the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method. Since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 25,000, the `minSegmentsToMove` should also be 25,000.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 12_500;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `totalSegmentsInTier` should be equal to the `minSegmentsToMove` calculated by the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method. Since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 12,500, the `minSegmentsToMove` should also be 12,500.
