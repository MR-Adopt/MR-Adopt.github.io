## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2021-H2";
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H1";
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1901;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1901-H2";
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2100-H1";
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2021-H2";
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H1";
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input3:
```java
    int year = 1901;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1901-H2";
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input for new source input4:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2100-H1";
```

The inferred relation is that the text string "YYYY-HX" represents a year and half-of-year. The new source inputs satisfy this relation by providing valid years and half-of-years, along with the corresponding text strings. The follow-up inputs are constructed by replacing the year and half-of-year in the original text string with the new source inputs.
