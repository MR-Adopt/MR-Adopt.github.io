## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
    YearHalf test = YearHalf.of(year, expected);
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year, expected), test);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object is created by calling the `of` method with the year and expected values. The `of` method takes the year and half-of-year as parameters and returns a `YearHalf` object. The `assertEquals` method is used to verify that the created `YearHalf` object matches the expected `YearHalf` object.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
    YearHalf test = YearHalf.of(year, expected);
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year, expected), test);
```

The `of` method takes the year and half-of-year as parameters and returns a `YearHalf` object. The `assertEquals` method is used to verify that the created `YearHalf` object matches the expected `YearHalf` object.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
    YearHalf test = YearHalf.of(year, expected);
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year, expected), test);
```
