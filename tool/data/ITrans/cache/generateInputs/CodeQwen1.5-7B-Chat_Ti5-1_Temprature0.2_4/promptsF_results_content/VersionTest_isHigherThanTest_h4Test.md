# New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `a` is higher than `b`, then `a.major` is higher than `b.major`, `a.minor` is higher than `b.minor`, and `a.revision` is higher than `b.revision`. Since `v1` has a higher minor version than `v2`, `v1` is higher than `v2`.

# New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha1";
    String v2 = "1.0-alpha2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `a` is higher than `b`, then `a.major` is higher than `b.major`, `a.minor` is higher than `b.minor`, and `a.revision` is higher than `b.revision`. Since `v1` has a higher minor version than `v2`, `v1` is higher than `v2`.

# New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-beta1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-beta2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `a` is higher than `b`, then `a.major` is higher than `b.major`, `a.minor` is higher than `b.minor`, and `a.revision` is higher than `b.revision`. Since `v1` has a higher minor version than `v2`, `v1` is higher than `v2`.

# New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0+build123";
    String v2 = "1.1.0+build124";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `a` is higher than `b`, then `a.major` is higher than `b.major`, `a.minor` is higher than `b.minor`, and `a.revision` is higher than `b.revision`. Since `v1` has a higher minor version than `v2`, `v1` is higher than `v2`.

# New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0+build123";
    String v2 = "1.0.1+build124";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `a` is higher than `b`, then `a.major` is higher than `b.major`, `a.minor` is higher than `b.minor`, and `a.revision` is higher than `b.revision`. Since `v1` has a higher minor version than `v2`, `v1` is higher than `v2`.
