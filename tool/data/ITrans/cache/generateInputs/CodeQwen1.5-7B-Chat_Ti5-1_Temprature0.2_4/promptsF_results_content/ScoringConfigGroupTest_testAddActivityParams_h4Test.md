## New input pair0:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("");
    String type = "";
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the source input `ap` is a new `ActivityParams` object with an empty string as the activity type. The follow-up input `type` is also an empty string, which matches the activity type of the source input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams(null);
    String type = null;
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the source input `ap` is a new `ActivityParams` object with a null activity type. The follow-up input `type` is also null, which matches the activity type of the source input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type1");
    ap.setMaximumDuration(0);
    String type = "type1";
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the source input `ap` is a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type "type1" and a maximum duration of 0. The follow-up input `type` is also "type1", which matches the activity type of the source input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type1");
    ap.setMaximumDuration(Double.MAX_VALUE);
    String type = "type1";
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the source input `ap` is a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type "type1" and a maximum duration of `Double.MAX_VALUE`. The follow-up input `type` is also "type1", which matches the activity type of the source input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type1");
    ap.setMinimumDuration(Double.MAX_VALUE);
    String type = "type1";
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the source input `ap` is a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type "type1" and a minimum duration of `Double.MAX_VALUE`. The follow-up input `type` is also "type1", which matches the activity type of the source input.
