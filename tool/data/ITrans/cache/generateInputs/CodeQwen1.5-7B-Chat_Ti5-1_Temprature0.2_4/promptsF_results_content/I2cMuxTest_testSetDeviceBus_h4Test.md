## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The new input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation because it starts a new instance of `I2cMux` with the name "i2cMux" and sets the device bus to "0" using the `setDeviceBus` method. It then starts another instance of `I2cMux` with the same name and verifies that the device bus is correctly set by comparing it with the expected value using the `assertEquals` method.

## New input pair1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The new input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation because it starts a new instance of `I2cMux` with the name "i2cMux" and sets the device bus to "7" using the `setDeviceBus` method. It then starts another instance of `I2cMux` with the same name and verifies that the device bus is correctly set by comparing it with the expected value using the `assertEquals` method.

## New input pair2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The new input pair2 satisfies the inferred relation because it starts a new instance of `I2cMux` with the name "i2cMux" and sets the device bus to "3" using the `setDeviceBus` method. It then starts another instance of `I2cMux` with the same name and verifies that the device bus is correctly set by comparing it with the expected value using the `assertEquals` method.

## New input pair3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The new input pair3 satisfies the inferred relation because it starts a new instance of `I2cMux` with the name "i2cMux" and sets the device bus to "8" using the `setDeviceBus` method. It then starts another instance of `I2cMux` with the same name and verifies that the device bus is correctly set by comparing it with the expected value using the `assertEquals` method.

## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The new input pair4 satisfies the inferred relation because it starts a new instance of `I2cMux` with the name "i2cMux" and sets the device bus to an empty string using the `setDeviceBus` method. It then starts another instance of `I2cMux` with the same name and verifies that the device bus is correctly set by comparing it with the expected value using the `assertEquals` method.
