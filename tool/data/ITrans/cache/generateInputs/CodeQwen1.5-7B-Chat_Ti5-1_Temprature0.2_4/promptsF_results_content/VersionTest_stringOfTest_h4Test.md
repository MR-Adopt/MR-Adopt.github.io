## New input pair0:
```java
    String v = "1.0";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to the input `v`. Since `v` is "1.0", the output should also be "1.0".

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v = "1.0-A1";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to the input `v`. Since `v` is "1.0-A1", the output should also be "1.0-A1".

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v = "1.1.0";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to the input `v`. Since `v` is "1.1.0", the output should also be "1.1.0".

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v = "1.1.0-A1";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to the input `v`. Since `v` is "1.1.0-A1", the output should also be "1.1.0-A1".

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v = "1.0.0-A1+123";
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of `Version.valueOf(v)` should be equal to the input `v`. Since `v` is "1.0.0-A1+123", the output should also be "1.0.0-A1+123".
