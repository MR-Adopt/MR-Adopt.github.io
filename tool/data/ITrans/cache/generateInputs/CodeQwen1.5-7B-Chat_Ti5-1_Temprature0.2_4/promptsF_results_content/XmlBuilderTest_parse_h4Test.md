## New input pair1:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The new input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation because it is the same as the original source input `XML`. The method `XmlBuilder.parse(String xml)` takes a string `xml` as input and returns an instance of `XmlBuilder` which is then assigned to `xmlBuilder2`. This is consistent with the original test case where `xmlBuilder2` is assigned the result of parsing the same XML string `XML`.
