## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event 2");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
In this new input pair, `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with two different `FilterEvent` objects, `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2`. Since `filter` and `filter2` are different objects, their internal events lists are also different. Therefore, the inferred relation between the pair of test inputs `filter` and `filter2` is that they are not the same object.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = mockEvent1;
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
In this new input pair, `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with the same `FilterEvent` object, `mockEvent1`. Since `filter` and `filter2` are different objects, their internal events lists are also different. Therefore, the inferred relation between the pair of test inputs `filter` and `filter2` is that they are not the same object.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
In this new input pair, `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with two different `FilterEvent` objects, `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2`. However, `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2` are the same object. Since `filter` and `filter2` are different objects, their internal events lists are also different. Therefore, the inferred relation between the pair of test inputs `filter` and `filter2` is that they are not the same object.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    FilterEvent mockEvent1 = new FilterEventMock("Event 1");
    FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event 2");
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
In this new input pair, `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with two different `FilterEvent` objects, `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2`. However, `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2` are different objects. Since `filter` and `filter2` are different objects, their internal events lists are also different. Therefore, the inferred relation between the pair of test inputs `filter` and `filter2` is that they are not the same object.
