## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
## Explanation:
For the new source input pair0, the inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL should be the same. Since the skin URL is null in both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock, the hashCode of both objects should be 0, which is the expected result.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin2"));
```
## Explanation:
For the new source input pair1, the inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with different skin URLs should be different. Since the skin URLs are different in both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock, the hashCode of both objects should be different, which is the expected result.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", "value");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
```
## Explanation:
For the new source input pair2, the inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL and the same ProfileProperty should be the same. Since the skin URL and ProfileProperty are the same in both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock, the hashCode of both objects should be the same, which is the expected result.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", "value");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProperty(null);
```
## Explanation:
For the new source input pair3, the inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL and the same ProfileProperty should be the same. Since the skin URL and ProfileProperty are the same in both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock, the hashCode of both objects should be the same, which is the expected result.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", "value");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
```
## Explanation:
For the new source input pair4, the inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL and the same ProfileProperty should be the same. Since the skin URL and ProfileProperty are the same in both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock, the hashCode of both objects should be the same, which is the expected result.
