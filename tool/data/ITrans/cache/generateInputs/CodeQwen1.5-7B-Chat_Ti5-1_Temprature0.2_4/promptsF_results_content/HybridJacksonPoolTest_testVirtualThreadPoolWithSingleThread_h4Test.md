## New input pair0:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: Since the capacity of the pool is 0, the `acquirePooled()` method will always return a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance, regardless of the number of times `releasePooled()` is called. Therefore, the new source input `virtualPool` and the new source input `virtualPool2` are the same, and they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: Since the capacity of the pool is 1, the `acquirePooled()` method will return the same `BufferRecycler` instance if it has been released once, and a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance if it has not been released. Therefore, the new source input `virtualPool` and the new source input `virtualPool2` are the same, and they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: Since the capacity of the pool is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the `acquirePooled()` method will always return a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance, regardless of the number of times `releasePooled()` is called. Therefore, the new source input `virtualPool` and the new source input `virtualPool2` are the same, and they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: Since the capacity of the pool is `-1`, the `acquirePooled()` method will always return a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance, regardless of the number of times `releasePooled()` is called. Therefore, the new source input `virtualPool` and the new source input `virtualPool2` are the same, and they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(2);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(2);
```
Explanation: Since the capacity of the pool is 2, the `acquirePooled()` method will return the same `BufferRecycler` instance if it has been released once, and a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance if it has not been released. Therefore, the new source input `virtualPool` and the new source input `virtualPool2` are the same, and they satisfy the inferred relation.
