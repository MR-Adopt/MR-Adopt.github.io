## New input pair0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 0;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `isLeapYear` should be the same as the output of the method `of` when the input year is 0. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can create a new input pair where the year is 0 and the half is Half.H1. The corresponding follow-up input is `test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half)`, which creates a `YearHalf` object using the year 0 and the half 1.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 9999;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `isLeapYear` should be the same as the output of the method `of` when the input year is 9999. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can create a new input pair where the year is 9999 and the half is Half.H2. The corresponding follow-up input is `test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half)`, which creates a `YearHalf` object using the year 9999 and the half 2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 10000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `isLeapYear` should be the same as the output of the method `of` when the input year is 10000. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can create a new input pair where the year is 10000 and the half is Half.H1. The corresponding follow-up input is `test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half)`, which creates a `YearHalf` object using the year 10000 and the half 1.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = -1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `isLeapYear` should be the same as the output of the method `of` when the input year is -1. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can create a new input pair where the year is -1 and the half is Half.H2. The corresponding follow-up input is `test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half)`, which creates a `YearHalf` object using the year -1 and the half 2.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = -10000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the method `isLeapYear` should be the same as the output of the method `of` when the input year is -10000. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we can create a new input pair where the year is -10000 and the half is Half.H1. The corresponding follow-up input is `test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half)`, which creates a `YearHalf` object using the year -10000 and the half 1.
