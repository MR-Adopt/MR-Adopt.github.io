## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Therefore, to generate a follow-up input, we can create a YearHalf object using the new source input and then convert it to a string using the toString() method.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Therefore, to generate a follow-up input, we can create a YearHalf object using the new source input and then convert it to a string using the toString() method.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Therefore, to generate a follow-up input, we can create a YearHalf object using the new source input and then convert it to a string using the toString() method.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2100-h1";
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Therefore, to generate a follow-up input, we can create a YearHalf object using the new source input and then convert it to a string using the toString() method.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1800-h2";
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-hH". Therefore, to generate a follow-up input, we can create a YearHalf object using the new source input and then convert it to a string using the toString() method.
