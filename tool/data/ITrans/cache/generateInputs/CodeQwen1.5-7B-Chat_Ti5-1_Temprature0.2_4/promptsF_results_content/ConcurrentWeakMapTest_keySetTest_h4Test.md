# New input pair0:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(5, 6);
    map.put(3, 6);
    map.put(4, 6);
    map.put(1, 1);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the keySet() method of the ConcurrentWeakMap class should return the same set of keys as the keySet() method of the HashMap class. Therefore, we can add a new key-value pair to the HashMap and then call the keySet() method to obtain the set of keys. The new key-value pair (1, 1) will be added to the HashMap, and the keySet() method will return a set containing the keys 5, 3, 4, and 1. This set is then compared with the keySet() method of the ConcurrentWeakMap class, which should also return a set containing the same keys.

Therefore, we can add a new key-value pair to the HashMap and then call the keySet() method to obtain the set of keys. The new key-value pair (0, 0) will be added to the HashMap, and the keySet() method will return a set containing the keys 5, 3, 4, and 0. This set is then compared with the keySet() method of the ConcurrentWeakMap class, which should also return a set containing the same keys.
