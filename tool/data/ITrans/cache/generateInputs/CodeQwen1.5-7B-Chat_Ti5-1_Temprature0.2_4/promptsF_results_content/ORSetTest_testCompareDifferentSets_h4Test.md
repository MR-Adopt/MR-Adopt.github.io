## New input pair1:
```java
    String element2 = "B";
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
String element2 = "B";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is a string and the follow-up input is also a string. The source input is `element`, which is a string, and the follow-up input is `element2`, which is also a string. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String element2 = "C";
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
String element2 = "C";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is a string and the follow-up input is also a string. The source input is `element`, which is a string, and the follow-up input is `element2`, which is also a string. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String element2 = "D";
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
String element2 = "D";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is a string and the follow-up input is also a string. The source input is `element`, which is a string, and the follow-up input is `element2`, which is also a string. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
