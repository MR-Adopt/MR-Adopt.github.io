## New input pair0:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
    String key2 = "key1";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, then `nameState.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, the follow-up input satisfies this relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key2";
    String key2 = "key2";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, then `nameState.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, the follow-up input satisfies this relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "";
    String key2 = "";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, then `nameState.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, the follow-up input satisfies this relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = null;
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = null;
    String key = "key";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, then `nameState.getNextNameState(key2)` should return the same `nextNameState` as `nameState.getNextNameState(key)`. Since `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, the follow-up input satisfies this relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
