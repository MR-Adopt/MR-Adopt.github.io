## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input0 `year = 0` and `half = 1` satisfies the inferred relation because the `of` method in the `YearHalf` class accepts any valid year and half-of-year values, including 0 and 1. Therefore, the `YearHalf` object `test2` created with these inputs will be valid and satisfy the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input1 `year = 9999` and `half = 2` satisfies the inferred relation because the `of` method in the `YearHalf` class accepts any valid year and half-of-year values, including 9999 and 2. Therefore, the `YearHalf` object `test2` created with these inputs will be valid and satisfy the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 5000;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input2 `year = 5000` and `half = 1` satisfies the inferred relation because the `of` method in the `YearHalf` class accepts any valid year and half-of-year values, including 5000 and 1. Therefore, the `YearHalf` object `test2` created with these inputs will be valid and satisfy the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = -1;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input3 `year = -1` and `half = 2` satisfies the inferred relation because the `of` method in the `YearHalf` class accepts any valid year and half-of-year values, including -1 and 2. Therefore, the `YearHalf` object `test2` created with these inputs will be valid and satisfy the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 10000;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The new source input4 `year = 10000` and `half = 1` satisfies the inferred relation because the `of` method in the `YearHalf` class accepts any valid year and half-of-year values, including 10000 and 1. Therefore, the `YearHalf` object `test2` created with these inputs will be valid and satisfy the assertions in the original test case.
