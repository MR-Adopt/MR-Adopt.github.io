## New input pair1:
```java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    String input = sb.toString();
    String encoded2 = "AQIDBAUGBwgJCgsMDQ4PEBESExQVFhcYGRobHB0eHyAhIiMkJSYnKCkqKywtLi8wMTIzNDU2Nzg5Ojs8PT4_QEFCQ0RFRkdISUpLTE1OT1BRUlNUVVZXWFlaW1xdXl9gYWJj";
```
In the original test case, the input string is created by appending characters from 1 to 99 to an empty StringBuffer. The resulting string is then encoded using the Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe.encode method. The encoded string is compared to the expected value, and if they match, the test passes.

The new source input is a StringBuffer sb with an empty string as the initial input. The encoded2 string is the same as the original encoded string, so it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    String input = sb.toString();
    String encoded2 = "QmFzZTY0RW5jb2RlZFN0cmluZw==";
```
In the original test case, the input string is created by appending characters from 1 to 99 to an empty StringBuffer. The resulting string is then encoded using the Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe.encode method. The encoded string is compared to the expected value, and if they match, the test passes.

The new source input is a StringBuffer sb with an empty string as the initial input. The encoded2 string is the Base64 encoding of the empty string, so it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    String input = sb.toString();
    String encoded2 = "QmFzZTY0RW5jb2RlZFN0cmluZw==";
