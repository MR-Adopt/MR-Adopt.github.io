## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 1);
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2021, 2);
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 2);
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1600;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1600, 1);
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 0;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(0, 1);
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the year are directly related to the `YearHalf` object. The `YearHalf.of()` method takes in a year and a half, and returns a `YearHalf` object. The `lengthOfYear()` method of the `YearHalf` class returns the length of the year, which is either 365 or 366 depending on whether the year is a leap year or not.

For each new source input, the corresponding follow-up input is generated by calling the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same year and half values, but with the half value incremented by 1 if the half is H1, and decremented by 1 if the half is H2. This ensures that the new `YearHalf` object has a different half value than the original one, but still represents the same year.

The new input pairs satisfy the inferred relation because they represent different halves of the same year, but with different half values. This allows the test case to cover various scenarios and ensure that the `lengthOfYear()` method works correctly for different years and halves.
