## New input1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `requestKey1` has a different value for the `partition` field compared to `requestKey2`. This change in the `partition` field will result in a different hash code, as the hash code is based on the `group` and `partition` fields.

## New input2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `requestKey1` has a different value for the `offset` field compared to `requestKey2`. This change in the `offset` field will result in a different hash code, as the hash code is based on the `group`, `partition`, and `offset` fields.

## New input3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `requestKey1` has the same values for all fields as `requestKey2`. This will result in the same hash code, as the hash code is based on the `group`, `partition`, and `offset` fields.

## New input4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group1", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `requestKey1` has a different value for the `group` field compared to `requestKey2`. This change in the `group` field will result in a different hash code, as the hash code is based on the `group`, `partition`, and `offset` fields.

## New input5:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `requestKey1` has the same values for all fields as `requestKey2`. This will result in the same hash code, as the hash code is based on the `group`, `partition`, and `offset` fields.
