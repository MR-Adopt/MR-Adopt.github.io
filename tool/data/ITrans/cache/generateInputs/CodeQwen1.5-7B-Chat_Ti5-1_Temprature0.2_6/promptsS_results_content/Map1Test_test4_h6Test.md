## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("103", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional key-value pair ("103", 3F) in the map. This is a valid input because it maintains the integrity of the map and does not violate the requirements of the method under test.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("", 0F);
```
Explanation: This input includes an empty key-value pair ("", 0F) in the map. This is a valid input because it maintains the integrity of the map and does not violate the requirements of the method under test.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("101", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes a duplicate key-value pair ("101", 3F) in the map. This is a valid input because it maintains the integrity of the map and does not violate the requirements of the method under test.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put(null, 0F);
```
Explanation: This input includes a null key-value pair (null, 0F) in the map. This is a valid input because it maintains the integrity of the map and does not violate the requirements of the method under test.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("101", null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a null value for the key "101" in the map. This is a valid input because it maintains the integrity of the map and does not violate the requirements of the method under test.
