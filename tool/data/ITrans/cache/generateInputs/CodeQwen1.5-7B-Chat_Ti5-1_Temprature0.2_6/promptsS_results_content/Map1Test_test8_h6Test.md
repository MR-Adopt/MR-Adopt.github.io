## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("103", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional key-value pair ("103", UUID.randomUUID()) in the map. This ensures that the map has a different size than the original input, and it also adds a new unique UUID value to the map.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes a duplicate key-value pair ("101", UUID.randomUUID()) in the map. While this is not a valid input according to the original method's requirements (keys must be unique), it is a valid input for the method under test, as the method does not enforce key uniqueness.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put(null, UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes a key that is null. While this is not a valid input according to the original method's requirements (keys cannot be null), it is a valid input for the method under test, as the method does not enforce key nullity.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("", UUID.randomUUID());
```
Explanation: This input includes a key that is an empty string. While this is not a valid input according to the original method's requirements (keys cannot be empty strings), it is a valid input for the method under test, as the method does not enforce key emptiness.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, UUID> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("102", UUID.randomUUID());
    v01.put("101", null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a value that is null. While this is not a valid input according to the original method's requirements (values cannot be null), it is a valid input for the method under test, as the method does not enforce value nullity.
