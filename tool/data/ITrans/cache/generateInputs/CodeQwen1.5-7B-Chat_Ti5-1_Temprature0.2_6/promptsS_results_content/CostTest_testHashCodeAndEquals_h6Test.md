## New input1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, using 0 as the input ensures that the `hashCode` method will return a valid hash code.

## New input2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, using `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as the input ensures that the `hashCode` method will return a valid hash code.

## New input3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, using -1 as the input will cause an exception to be thrown.

## New input4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, using a large number as the input ensures that the `hashCode` method will return a valid hash code.

## New input5:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method is designed to handle non-negative integers. Therefore, using a large number as the input ensures that the `hashCode` method will return a valid hash code.
