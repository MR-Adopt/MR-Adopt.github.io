## New input1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000000");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the time to the earliest possible value, which is 00:00:00.000000000. This ensures that the serialized JSON will accurately represent the smallest possible LocalTime value.

## New input2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the time to the latest possible value, which is 23:59:59.999999999. This ensures that the serialized JSON will accurately represent the largest possible LocalTime value.

## New input3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    lts[0] = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000000");
    lts[1] = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the time to the earliest and latest possible values in the array. This ensures that the serialized JSON will accurately represent the smallest and largest possible LocalTime values.

## New input4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    lts[0] = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000000");
    lts[1] = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the time to the earliest and middle possible values in the array. This ensures that the serialized JSON will accurately represent the smallest, middle, and largest possible LocalTime values.

## New input5:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    lts[0] = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    lts[1] = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14.123456789");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the time to the latest and middle possible values in the array. This ensures that the serialized JSON will accurately represent the largest, middle, and smallest possible LocalTime values.
