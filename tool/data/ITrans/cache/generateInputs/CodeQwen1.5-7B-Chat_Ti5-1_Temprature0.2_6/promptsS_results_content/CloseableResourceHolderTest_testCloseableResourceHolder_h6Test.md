## New input1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a lambda expression that implements the `Closeable` interface. The lambda expression does not contain any code, so it does not throw any exceptions when closed. This is a valid and reasonable implementation of a `Closeable` resource.

## New input2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = System.out::close;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses the `close` method of `System.out`, which is a `Closeable` resource. This is a common and reasonable implementation of a `Closeable` resource.

## New input3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new anonymous class that implements the `Closeable` interface. The `close` method is overridden to do nothing, so it does not throw any exceptions when closed. This is a valid and reasonable implementation of a `Closeable` resource.

## New input4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FileInputStream("nonexistent.txt");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FileInputStream` for a non-existent file. This is a common and reasonable implementation of a `Closeable` resource.

## New input5:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[0]);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `ByteArrayInputStream` for an empty byte array. This is a common and reasonable implementation of a `Closeable` resource.
