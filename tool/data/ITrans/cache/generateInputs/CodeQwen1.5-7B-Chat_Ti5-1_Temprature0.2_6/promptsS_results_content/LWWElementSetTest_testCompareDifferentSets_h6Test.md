## New input1:
```java
Element element1 = new Element("key3", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with a different key ("key3") and a different timestamp (3). The bias value is used as the initial value for the timestamp.

## New input2:
```java
Element element2 = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with the same key ("key1") as the existing element in the set, but with a different timestamp (2). The bias value is used as the initial value for the timestamp.

## New input3:
```java
Element element3 = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with the same key ("key2") as the existing element in the set, but with a different timestamp (1). The bias value is used as the initial value for the timestamp.

## New input4:
```java
Element element4 = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with the same key ("key1") and timestamp (1) as the existing element in the set. The bias value is used as the initial value for the timestamp.

## New input5:
```java
Element element5 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input creates a new element with the same key ("key2") and timestamp (2) as the existing element in the set. The bias value is used as the initial value for the timestamp.
