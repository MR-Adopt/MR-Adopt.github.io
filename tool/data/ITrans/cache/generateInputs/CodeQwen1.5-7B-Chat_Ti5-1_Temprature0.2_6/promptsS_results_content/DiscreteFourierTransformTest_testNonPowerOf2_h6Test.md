## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(5, 1, Uniform.of(-10, 20));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(5);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 5x1 matrix with random values between -10 and 20. The dimension is a prime number, which is a common requirement for Fourier transforms.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(8, 1, Uniform.of(-5, 15));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(8);
```
Explanation: This input creates an 8x1 matrix with random values between -5 and 15. The dimension is a power of 2, which is a requirement for most Fourier transforms.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(10, 1, Uniform.of(-3, 7));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(10);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 10x1 matrix with random values between -3 and 7. The dimension is a prime number, which is a common requirement for Fourier transforms.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(12, 1, Uniform.of(-8, 24));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(12);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 12x1 matrix with random values between -8 and 24. The dimension is a power of 2, which is a requirement for most Fourier transforms.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(15, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 6));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(15);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 15x1 matrix with random values between -2 and 6. The dimension is a prime number, which is a common requirement for Fourier transforms.
