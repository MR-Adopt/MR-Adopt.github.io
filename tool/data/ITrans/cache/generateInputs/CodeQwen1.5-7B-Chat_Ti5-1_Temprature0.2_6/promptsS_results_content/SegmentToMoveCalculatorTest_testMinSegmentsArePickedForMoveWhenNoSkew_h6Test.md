## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of possible total segments in a tier. It is also a common scenario where the number of segments in a tier is significantly higher than the minimum required to ensure balance.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 500_000;
```

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1_000_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of possible total segments in a tier. It is also a common scenario where the number of segments in a tier is significantly higher than the minimum required to ensure balance.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is within the range of possible total segments in a tier. It is also a common scenario where the number of segments in a tier is significantly higher than the minimum required to ensure balance.

## New input5:
