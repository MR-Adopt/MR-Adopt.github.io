## New input1:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.minusYears(1));
```
Explanation: This input creates a new ZonedDateTime object that is one year earlier than the original ZonedDateTime object. This ensures that the ZonedDateTime array `lts` contains at least one ZonedDateTime object that is different from the original.

## New input2:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.plusMonths(2));
```
Explanation: This input creates a new ZonedDateTime object that is two months later than the original ZonedDateTime object. This ensures that the ZonedDateTime array `lts` contains at least one ZonedDateTime object that is different from the original.

## New input3:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.minusSeconds(5));
```
Explanation: This input creates a new ZonedDateTime object that is five seconds earlier than the original ZonedDateTime object. This ensures that the ZonedDateTime array `lts` contains at least one ZonedDateTime object that is different from the original.

## New input4:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.plusHours(3));
```
Explanation: This input creates a new ZonedDateTime object that is three hours later than the original ZonedDateTime object. This ensures that the ZonedDateTime array `lts` contains at least one ZonedDateTime object that is different from the original.

## New input5:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.minusMinutes(10));
```
Explanation: This input creates a new ZonedDateTime object that is ten minutes earlier than the original ZonedDateTime object. This ensures that the ZonedDateTime array `lts` contains at least one ZonedDateTime object that is different from the original.
