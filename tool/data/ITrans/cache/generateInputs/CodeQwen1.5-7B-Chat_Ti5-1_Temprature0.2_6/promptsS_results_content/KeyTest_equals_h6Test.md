## New input1:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Integer.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Integer.class` is a valid class type in Java, and it is used to create a `Key` object with the same type literal and annotation instance as the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Double.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Double.class` is a valid class type in Java, and it is used to create a `Key` object with the same type literal and annotation instance as the original test case.

## New input3:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Boolean.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Boolean.class` is a valid class type in Java, and it is used to create a `Key` object with the same type literal and annotation instance as the original test case.

## New input4:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Character.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Character.class` is a valid class type in Java, and it is used to create a `Key` object with the same type literal and annotation instance as the original test case.

## New input5:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Void.class;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because `Void.class` is a valid class type in Java, and it is used to create a `Key` object with the same type literal and annotation instance as the original test case.
