## New input1:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "Hello World".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a simple string "Hello World" encoded in UTF-8 format. This string is a common and widely used example in Base64 encoding.

## New input2:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "1234567890".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a string of digits. Base64 encoding can handle any binary data, including strings of digits, so this is a valid input.

## New input3:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "!@#$%^&*()".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a string of special characters. Base64 encoding can handle any binary data, including strings of special characters, so this is a valid input.

## New input4:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = "AaBbCcDdEeFfGg".getBytes();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a string of uppercase and lowercase letters. Base64 encoding can handle any binary data, including strings of letters, so this is a valid input.

## New input5:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a sequence of 16 bytes, each with a value from 0 to 15. This is a valid input because Base64 encoding can handle any binary data, including sequences of bytes with specific values.
