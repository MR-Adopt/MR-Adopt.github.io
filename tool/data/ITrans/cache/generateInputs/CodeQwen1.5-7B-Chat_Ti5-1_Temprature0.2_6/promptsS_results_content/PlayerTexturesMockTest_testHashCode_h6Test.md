## New input1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `PlayerTexturesMock` object with the same profile and sets the skin URL to "https://github.com/skin". This is a common scenario where the `hashCode` method is tested, and it is expected that two objects with the same state will have the same hash code.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `PlayerTexturesMock` object with the same profile and sets the skin URL to `null`. This is a scenario where the `hashCode` method is tested with a null value, and it is expected that two objects with the same state will have the same hash code.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin2"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `PlayerTexturesMock` object with the same profile and sets the skin URL to "https://github.com/skin2". This is a scenario where the `hashCode` method is tested with a different skin URL, and it is expected that two objects with the same state will have the same hash code.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `PlayerTexturesMock` object with the same profile and sets the skin URL to "https://github.com/skin" and the cape URL to "https://github.com/cape". This is a scenario where the `hashCode` method is tested with different textures, and it is expected that two objects with the same state will have the same hash code.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `PlayerTexturesMock` object with the same profile and sets the skin URL to "https://github.com/skin" twice. This is a scenario where the `hashCode` method is tested with the same skin URL twice, and it is expected that two objects with the same state will have the same hash code.
