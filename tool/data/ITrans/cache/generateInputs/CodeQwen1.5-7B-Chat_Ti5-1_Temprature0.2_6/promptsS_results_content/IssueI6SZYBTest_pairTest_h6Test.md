## New input1:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a pair with both elements as 0. This is a common scenario and should be covered by the test case.

## New input2:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(-1, -1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a pair with both elements as negative numbers. Negative numbers are a valid scenario and should be covered by the test case.

## New input3:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a pair with both elements as the maximum possible integer values. This is a boundary scenario and should be covered by the test case.

## New input4:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a pair with both elements as the minimum possible integer values. This is a boundary scenario and should be covered by the test case.

## New input5:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(null, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a pair with both elements as null. This is a null scenario and should be covered by the test case.
