## New input1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains unique keys and values that are not present in the original `anotherMap`. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set of unique keys, which is a requirement of the `keySet()` method.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(6, 8);
    anotherMap.put(7, 9);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains additional unique keys and values that are not present in the original `anotherMap`. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set of unique keys, which is a requirement of the `keySet()` method.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(5, 6);
    anotherMap.put(4, 5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains duplicate keys and values that are not present in the original `anotherMap`. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set of unique keys, which is a requirement of the `keySet()` method.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(null, 10);
    anotherMap.put(null, 3);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains null keys and values that are not present in the original `anotherMap`. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set of unique keys, which is a requirement of the `keySet()` method.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains duplicate keys and values that are not present in the original `anotherMap`. This ensures that the `keySet()` method returns a set of unique keys, which is a requirement of the `keySet()` method.
