## New input1:
```java
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("12x", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it maintains the integrity of the original map by adding two entries. The key "123" maps to the integer 123, and the key "12x" maps to the integer 123. This ensures that the map remains a valid map with the same key-value pairs.

## New input2:
```java
    v01.put("", 0);
    v01.put(" ", 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two entries with empty and space keys. The empty key maps to the integer 0, and the space key also maps to the integer 0. This ensures that the map remains a valid map with the same key-value pairs.

## New input3:
```java
    v01.put("null", null);
    v01.put("NULL", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two entries with "null" and "NULL" keys. The "null" key maps to null, and the "NULL" key also maps to null. This ensures that the map remains a valid map with the same key-value pairs.

## New input4:
```java
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("123", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two entries with the same key "123". The first entry maps to the integer 123, and the second entry also maps to the integer 123. This ensures that the map remains a valid map with the same key-value pairs.

## New input5:
```java
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("123", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two entries with the same key "123". The first entry maps to the integer 123, and the second entry maps to the integer 456. This ensures that the map remains a valid map with the same key-value pairs.
