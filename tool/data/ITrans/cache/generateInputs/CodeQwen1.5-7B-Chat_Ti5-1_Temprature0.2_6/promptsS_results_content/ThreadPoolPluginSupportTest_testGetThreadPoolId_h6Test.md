## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor1 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test1", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool id ("test1"), different core and maximum pool size (10), different keep alive time (2000L), different time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), different work queue (ArrayBlockingQueue<>(2)), different thread factory (Thread::new), and different rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy()). This input explores a different scenario from the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor2 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test2", manager, 0, 0, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool id ("test2"), different core and maximum pool size (0), different keep alive time (0L), different time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), different work queue (LinkedBlockingQueue<>()), different thread factory (Thread::new), and different rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy()). This input explores a different scenario from the original test case, as it uses a different work queue and rejection handler.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor3 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test3", manager, 5, 10, 500L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new PriorityBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool id ("test3"), different core and maximum pool size (5, 10), different keep alive time (500L), different time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), different work queue (PriorityBlockingQueue<>()), different thread factory (Thread::new), and different rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy()). This input explores a different scenario from the original test case, as it uses a different work queue and rejection handler.

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor4 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test4", manager, 1, 1, 100L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool id ("test4"), different core and maximum pool size (1, 1), different keep alive time (100L), different time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), different work queue (SynchronousQueue<>()), different thread factory (Thread::new), and different rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy()). This input explores a different scenario from the original test case, as it uses a different work queue and rejection handler.

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor5 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test5", manager, 3, 5, 3000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new DelayQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` instance with a different thread pool id ("test5"), different core and maximum pool size (3, 5), different keep alive time (3000L), different time unit (TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS), different work queue (DelayQueue<>()), different thread factory (Thread::new), and different rejection handler (ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy()). This input explores a different scenario from the original test case, as it uses a different work queue and rejection handler.
