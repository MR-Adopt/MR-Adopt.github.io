## New input1:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("test2", false);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the key from "test1" to "test2" and the value from true to false. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario from the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("test3", true);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the key from "test1" to "test3" while keeping the value as true. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario from the original test case.

## New input3:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("test4", false);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the key from "test1" to "test4" and the value from true to false. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario from the original test case.

## New input4:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("test5", true);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the key from "test1" to "test5" while keeping the value as true. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario from the original test case.

## New input5:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("", true);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the key from "test1" to an empty string while keeping the value as true. This ensures that the test case covers a different scenario from the original test case, including an edge case.
