## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", "def");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key "456" and the value "def" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", "ghi");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key "789" and the value "ghi" are both strings, which are valid entries in a HashMap.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "jkl");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it modifies the value associated with the key "123". The key "123" already exists in the map, and the new value "jkl" is a string, which is a valid entry in a HashMap.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "mno");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it modifies the value associated with the key "123". The key "123" already exists in the map, and the new value "mno" is a string, which is a valid entry in a HashMap.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, String> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", "pqr");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it modifies the value associated with the key "123". The key "123" already exists in the map, and the new value "pqr" is a string, which is a valid entry in a HashMap.
