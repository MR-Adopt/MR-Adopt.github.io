    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: Setting the device bus to "7" is also a valid input as it falls within the specified range.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "2";
```
Explanation: Setting the device bus to "2" is a valid input as it falls within the specified range.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "5";
```
Explanation: Setting the device bus to "5" is a valid input as it falls within the specified range.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
