## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the I2C address to a different value within the valid range "0x70" - "0x77". This ensures that the method under test is tested with a different input than the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the I2C address to a different value within the valid range "0x70" - "0x77". This ensures that the method under test is tested with a different input than the original test case.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7F";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the I2C address to a different value within the valid range "0x70" - "0x77". This ensures that the method under test is tested with a different input than the original test case.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the I2C address to a different value within the valid range "0x70" - "0x77". This ensures that the method under test is tested with a different input than the original test case.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0xFF";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the I2C address to a different value within the valid range "0x70" - "0x77". This ensures that the method under test is tested with a different input than the original test case.
