    String plaintext = "HELLO";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different keyword "SECRET" than the original test case. The keyword "SECRET" is a commonly used keyword in the Playfair cipher, and it is a valid input. The plaintext "HELLO" is a simple and common English word, and it is a valid input.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAM";
