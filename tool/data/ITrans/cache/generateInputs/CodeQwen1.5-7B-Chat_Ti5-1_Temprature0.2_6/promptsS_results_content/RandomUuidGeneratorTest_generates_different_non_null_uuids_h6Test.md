## New input1:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new FixedUuidGenerator(UUID.fromString("550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"));
```
Explanation: This input uses a fixed UUID generator that always returns the same UUID value. This is not a realistic scenario, but it is useful for testing the behavior of the system when the UUID generator is not producing unique values.

## New input2:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new SequentialUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a sequential UUID generator that generates UUIDs in a predictable order. This is useful for testing the behavior of the system when the UUID generator is producing predictable values.

## New input3:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new NullUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a null UUID generator that always returns null. This is not a realistic scenario, but it is useful for testing the behavior of the system when the UUID generator is not producing valid values.

## New input4:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new EmptyUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses an empty UUID generator that always returns an empty string. This is not a realistic scenario, but it is useful for testing the behavior of the system when the UUID generator is not producing valid values.

## New input5:
```java
UuidGenerator generator = new InvalidUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses an invalid UUID generator that always throws an exception. This is not a realistic scenario, but it is useful for testing the behavior of the system when the UUID generator is not producing valid values.
