## New input pair0:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the original test case compares the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects with the same group, partition, and offset, it is reasonable to assume that the hashCode of the first object should be equal to the hashCode of the second object. Therefore, the follow-up input is a new InFlightRequestKey object with the same group, partition, and offset as the original requestKey1, but with a different offset.

## New input pair1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group1", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group1", 0, 0);
