# REQUIRED DELIVERABLE

## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL should be the same. The new input pair satisfies this relation by setting the skin URL of both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock to the same value.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL should be the same. The new input pair satisfies this relation by setting the skin URL of both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock to null.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin2"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin2"));
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin2"));
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin2"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin2"));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL should be the same. The new input pair satisfies this relation by setting the skin URL of both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock to the same value.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two PlayerTexturesMock objects with the same skin URL and cape URL should be the same. The new input pair satisfies this relation by setting the skin and cape URL of both playerTexturesMock and otherPlayerTexturesMock to the same value.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));

    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Generation code:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    PlayerTexturesMock otherPlayerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    otherPlayerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
