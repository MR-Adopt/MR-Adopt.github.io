## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element2` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element3 = new Element("key3", 3, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element3 = new Element("key3", 3, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element3` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element4 = new Element("key4", 4, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element4 = new Element("key4", 4, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element4` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Element element5 = new Element("key5", 5, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element5 = new Element("key5", 5, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element5` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair5:
```java
    Element element6 = new Element("key6", 6, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element6 = new Element("key6", 6, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element6` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair6:
```java
    Element element7 = new Element("key7", 7, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element7 = new Element("key7", 7, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element7` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair7:
```java
    Element element8 = new Element("key8", 8, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element8 = new Element("key8", 8, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element8` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair8:
```java
    Element element9 = new Element("key9", 9, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element9 = new Element("key9", 9, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element9` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair9:
```java
    Element element10 = new Element("key10", 10, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element10 = new Element("key10", 10, bias);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `add` method adds an element to the `addSet` map. Since the `add` method is called with `element10` as the argument, it satisfies the inferred relation.
