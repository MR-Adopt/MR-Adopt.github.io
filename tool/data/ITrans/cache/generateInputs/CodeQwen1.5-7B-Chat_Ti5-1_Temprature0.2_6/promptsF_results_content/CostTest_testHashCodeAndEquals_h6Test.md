## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects is equal if and only if they have the same value. Since the hashCode of a Cost object is based on its value, if the value of the subject and other Cost objects are the same, their hashCodes should also be the same. Therefore, the follow-up input `other` has the same value as `subject`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects is equal if and only if they have the same value. Since the hashCode of a Cost object is based on its value, if the value of the subject and other Cost objects are the same, their hashCodes should also be the same. Therefore, the follow-up input `other` has the same value as `subject`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects is equal if and only if they have the same value. Since the hashCode of a Cost object is based on its value, if the value of the subject and other Cost objects are the same, their hashCodes should also be the same. Therefore, the follow-up input `other` has the same value as `subject`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
```
