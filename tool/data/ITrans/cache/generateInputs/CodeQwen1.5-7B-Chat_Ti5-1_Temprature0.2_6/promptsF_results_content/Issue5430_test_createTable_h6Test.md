For the new source input0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation is that the original SQL statement and the new SQL statement should have the same normalized form. The normalization process involves removing unnecessary whitespace, replacing single quotes with double quotes, and adjusting the format of the SQL statement.

For the new source input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation is that the original SQL statement and the new SQL statement should have the same normalized form. The normalization process involves removing unnecessary whitespace, replacing single quotes with double quotes, and adjusting the format of the SQL statement.

The new input pairs satisfy the inferred relation because the original SQL statement and the new SQL statement have the same normalized form after applying the normalization process.
