## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 0;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1;
    int year3 = 1;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 0;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getHalf().getValue();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the resulting `YearHalf` object should be the same as the original `YearHalf` object. This is because the `with` method of `YearHalf` does not change the year or half, it only adjusts the date. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 9999;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 10000;
    int year3 = 10000;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 9999;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 10000;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getHalf().getValue();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the resulting `YearHalf` object should be the same as the original `YearHalf` object. This is because the `with` method of `YearHalf` does not change the year or half, it only adjusts the date. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 5000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 5000;
    int year3 = 5000;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 5000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 5000;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getHalf().getValue();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the resulting `YearHalf` object should be the same as the original `YearHalf` object. This is because the `with` method of `YearHalf` does not change the year or half, it only adjusts the date. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = -1;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = -2;
    int year3 = -2;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = -1;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = -2;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getHalf().getValue();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the year and half of the resulting `YearHalf` object should be the same as the original `YearHalf` object. This is because the `with` method of `YearHalf` does not change the year or half, it only adjusts the date. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 3000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 3001;
    int year3 = 3001;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 3000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 3001;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2)).getHalf().getValue();
