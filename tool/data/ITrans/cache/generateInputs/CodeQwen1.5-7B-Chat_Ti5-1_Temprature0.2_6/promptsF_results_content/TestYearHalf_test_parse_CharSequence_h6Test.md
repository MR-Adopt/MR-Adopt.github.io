## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the `YearHalf` object should match the input text. Since `YearHalf.of(year, half)` creates a `YearHalf` object with the given year and half, and `toString()` method returns the text representation of the `YearHalf` object, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2021-H2";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the `YearHalf` object should match the input text. Since `YearHalf.of(year, half)` creates a `YearHalf` object with the given year and half, and `toString()` method returns the text representation of the `YearHalf` object, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H1";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the `YearHalf` object should match the input text. Since `YearHalf.of(year, half)` creates a `YearHalf` object with the given year and half, and `toString()` method returns the text representation of the `YearHalf` object, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1901;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1901-H2";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1901;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of the `YearHalf` object should match the input text. Since `YearHalf.of(year, half)` creates a `YearHalf` object with the given year and half, and `toString()` method returns the text representation of the `YearHalf` object, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "9999-H2";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
