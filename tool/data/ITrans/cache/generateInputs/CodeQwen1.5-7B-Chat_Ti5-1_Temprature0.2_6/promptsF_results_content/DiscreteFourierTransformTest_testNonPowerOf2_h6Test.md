## New input pair0:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(5, 1, Uniform.of(-10, 20));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(5);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
        transformer.transform(input, DiscreteFourierTransform.DEFAULT, (PhysicalStore<ComplexNumber>) transformed2);
```

## Explanation for new input pair0:
In the original test case, the `transformer.transform` method is called with the `input` and `transformed2` as parameters. The `transformer.transform` method takes a `PhysicalStore<Double>` and a `DiscreteFourierTransform.Mode` as input and returns a `MatrixStore<ComplexNumber>`. The `DiscreteFourierTransform.Mode` is set to `DiscreteFourierTransform.DEFAULT`. The `transformer.transform` method modifies the `transformed2` store in place.

For the new input pair0, the `input` is a `PhysicalStore<Double>` filled with 5 random numbers between -10 and 20. The `transformer` is a `DiscreteFourierTransform` instance created with 5 as the dimension. The `transformed2` is a `MatrixStore<ComplexNumber>` created with 5 rows and 1 column.

The `transformer.transform` method is called with the `input` and `transformed2` as parameters. The `DiscreteFourierTransform.Mode` is set to `DiscreteFourierTransform.DEFAULT`. The `transformer.transform` method modifies the `transformed2` store in place.

The new input pair0 satisfies the inferred relation because it calls the `transformer.transform` method with the same `input` and `transformed2` as the original test case. The `transformed2` store is modified in place, and the `transformer.inverse` method is called with the `transformed2` as the input to verify that the transformation is correct.

```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(8, 1, Uniform.of(-5, 15));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(8);
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = GenericStore.C128.makeDense(input.size(), 1);
        transformer.transform(input, DiscreteFourierTransform.DEFAULT, (PhysicalStore<ComplexNumber>) transformed2);
```
