# NEW SOURCE INPUTS
## New source input0:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```

### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```

### Explanation:
The new source input0 is the same as the original source input, `executor`. This satisfies the inferred relation as the `getThreadPoolId()` method is called on the `executor` object, and the result is used to create a new `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object.

## New source input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```

### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```

### Explanation:
The new source input1 is the same as the original source input, `executor`. This satisfies the inferred relation as the `getThreadPoolId()` method is called on the `executor` object, and the result is used to create a new `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object.

## New source input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```

### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```

### Explanation:
The new source input2 is the same as the original source input, `executor`. This satisfies the inferred relation as the `getThreadPoolId()` method is called on the `executor` object, and the result is used to create a new `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object.
