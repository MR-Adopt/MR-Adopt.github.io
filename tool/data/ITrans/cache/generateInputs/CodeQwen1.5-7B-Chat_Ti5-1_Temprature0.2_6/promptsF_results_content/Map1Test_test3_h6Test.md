## New input pair0:
```java
    Map<String, Boolean> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", true);
    v01.put("102", false);
    v01.put("103", true);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String str2 = toJSONString(v01, null, null, JSONWriter.Feature.WriteMapNullValue);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the `toJSONString` method should be the same as the input `v01` after serialization. The new input pair `v01` includes an additional key-value pair ("103", true), which should be included in the serialized output. Therefore, the follow-up input `str2` is generated by serializing `v01` using the `toJSONString` method with the `WriteMapNullValue` feature enabled.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Map<String, Boolean> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", true);
    v01.put("102", false);
    v01.put("", true);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    String str2 = toJSONString(v01, null, null, JSONWriter.Feature.WriteMapNullValue);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the output of the `toJSONString` method should be the same as the input `v01` after serialization. The new input pair `v01` includes an additional key-value pair ("", true), which should be included in the serialized output. Therefore, the follow-up input `str2` is generated by serializing `v01` using the `toJSONString` method with the `WriteMapNullValue` feature enabled.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Map<String, Boolean> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", true);
    v01.put("102", false);
    v01.put("null", true);
```

```java
    String str2 = toJSONString(v01, null, null, JSONWriter.Feature.WriteMapNullValue);

## New input pair3:

    v01.put("101", true);
    v01.put("102", false);
    v01.put("true", true);
