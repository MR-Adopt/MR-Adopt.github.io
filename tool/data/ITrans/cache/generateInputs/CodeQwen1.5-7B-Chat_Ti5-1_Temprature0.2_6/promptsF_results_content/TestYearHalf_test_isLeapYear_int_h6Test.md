# New input pair0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2000;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the output of the method `isLeapYear()` depends on the input `year`. Since the original test case checks if the year 500 is a leap year, we can infer that the output of `isLeapYear()` should be the same for the year 2000. Therefore, we can generate the follow-up input by calling the method `of()` with the year 2000 and the half 2, which will create a `YearHalf` object with the same year and half as the original test case.

# New input pair1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 1900;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

The inferred relation is that the output of the method `isLeapYear()` depends on the input `year`.
