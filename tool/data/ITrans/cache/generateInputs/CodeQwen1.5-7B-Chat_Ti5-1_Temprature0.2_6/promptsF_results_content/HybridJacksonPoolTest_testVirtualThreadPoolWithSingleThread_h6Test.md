# REQUIRED DELIVERABLE
## New input pair0:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when the number of threads is 0. Since the number of threads is 0, the pooled resources should be the same for both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when the number of threads is 1. Since the number of threads is 1, the pooled resources should be the same for both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when the number of threads is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Since the number of threads is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the pooled resources should be the same for both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(4);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(4);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when the number of threads is 4. Since the number of threads is 4, the pooled resources should be the same for both `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2`.
