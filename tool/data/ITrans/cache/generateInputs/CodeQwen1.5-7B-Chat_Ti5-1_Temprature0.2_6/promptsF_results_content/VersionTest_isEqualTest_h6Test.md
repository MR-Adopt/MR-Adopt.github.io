## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isEqual` method should return `false` if the two versions are not equal. Since the input `v1` is "1.0-A1" and the input `v2` is also "1.0-A1", they are not equal, so the `isEqual` method should return `false`.

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isEqual` method should return `true` if the two versions are equal. Since the input `v1` is "1.1.0" and the input `v2` is also "1.1.0", they are equal, so the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isEqual` method should return `true` if the two versions are equal. Since the input `v1` is "1.1.0-A1" and the input `v2` is also "1.1.0-A1", they are equal, so the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isEqual` method should return `true` if the two versions are equal. Since the input `v1` is "1.0.0-A1" and the input `v2` is also "1.0.0-A1", they are equal, so the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1.1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1.1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isEqual` method should return `true` if the two versions are equal. Since the input `v1` is "1.0.0-A1.1" and the input `v2` is also "1.0.0-A1.1", they are equal, so the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1.1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1.1";
```
