## New input pair0:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("work");
    String type = "work";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String type = "work";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `ap` is the same as the follow-up input `type`. This is because the `addActivityParams` method takes an `ActivityParams` object as a parameter and expects the activity type to be obtained from it. Therefore, when we create a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type "work", we can use the same activity type as the follow-up input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("education");
    String type = "education";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String type = "education";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `ap` is the same as the follow-up input `type`. This is because the `addActivityParams` method takes an `ActivityParams` object as a parameter and expects the activity type to be obtained from it. Therefore, when we create a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type "education", we can use the same activity type as the follow-up input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("leisure");
    String type = "leisure";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String type = "leisure";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `ap` is the same as the follow-up input `type`. This is because the `addActivityParams` method takes an `ActivityParams` object as a parameter and expects the activity type to be obtained from it. Therefore, when we create a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type "leisure", we can use the same activity type as the follow-up input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("shopping");
    String type = "shopping";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String type = "shopping";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `ap` is the same as the follow-up input `type`. This is because the `addActivityParams` method takes an `ActivityParams` object as a parameter and expects the activity type to be obtained from it. Therefore, when we create a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type "shopping", we can use the same activity type as the follow-up input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("unknown");
    String type = "unknown";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String type = "unknown";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input `ap` is the same as the follow-up input `type`. This is because the `addActivityParams` method takes an `ActivityParams` object as a parameter and expects the activity type to be obtained from it. Therefore, when we create a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type "unknown", we can use the same activity type as the follow-up input.
