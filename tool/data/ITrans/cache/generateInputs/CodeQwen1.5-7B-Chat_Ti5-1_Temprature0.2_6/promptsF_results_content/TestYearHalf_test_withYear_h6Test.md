# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2025;
    int year3 = 2025;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input0:
```java
int year1 = 2020;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2025;
int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getYear();
int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getHalf().getValue();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `withYear` method should return a `YearHalf` object with the same year and half as the original `YearHalf` object, but with the year changed to the new value. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to call the `withYear` method on the original `YearHalf` object with the new year value and store the result in `year3` and `half3`.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1990;
    int half1 = 2;

    int year3 = 1995;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java

int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getHalf().getValue();
