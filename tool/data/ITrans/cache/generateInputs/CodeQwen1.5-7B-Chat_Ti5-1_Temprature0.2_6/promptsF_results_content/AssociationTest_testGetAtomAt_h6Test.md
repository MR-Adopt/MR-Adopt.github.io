## New input pair0:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 1;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, n);
    int position2 = 1;
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = -1;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, o);
    int position2 = 0;
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 2;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, o);
    int position2 = 0;
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 0;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, o);
    int position2 = 0;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `position` in the `setAtomAt` method corresponds to the index in the `atoms` array of the `Association` class. When we set an atom at a specific position, it replaces the atom at that position in the array. Therefore, when we retrieve the atom at the same position using the `getAtomAt` method, we should get the same atom that was set.

For the new source inputs, we have:
- New input pair0: `position = 1`
  - The `setAtomAt` method is called with `n` at position `1`. This replaces the atom at position `1` in the `atoms` array of `association`.
  - The `getAtomAt` method is called with `position2 = 1` on `association2`. This retrieves the atom at position `1` in the `atoms` array of `association2`, which should be `n`.

- New input pair1: `position = -1`
  - The `setAtomAt` method is called with `n` at position `-1`. This does not change the `atoms` array of `association` because the position is out of bounds.
  - The `getAtomAt` method is called with `position2 = 0` on `association2`. This retrieves the atom at position `0` in the `atoms` array of `association2`, which should be `c`.

- New input pair2: `position = 2`
  - The `setAtomAt` method is called with `n` at position `2`. This does not change the `atoms` array of `association` because the position is out of bounds.
  - The `getAtomAt` method is called with `position2 = 0` on `association2`. This retrieves the atom at position `0` in the `atoms` array of `association2`, which should be `c`.

- New input pair3: `position = 0`
  - The `setAtomAt` method is called with `n` at position `0`. This replaces the atom at position `0` in the `atoms` array of `association`.
  - The `getAtomAt` method is called with `position2 = 0` on `association2`. This retrieves the atom at position `0` in the `atoms` array of `association2`, which should be `n`.
