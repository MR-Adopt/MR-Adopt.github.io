# New input pair1:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two AuditInfo objects is equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and ip. Since the source input `auditInfo1` has the same author, identity, comment, and ip as the follow-up input `auditInfo2`, their hashCodes will be equal.

# New input pair2:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
