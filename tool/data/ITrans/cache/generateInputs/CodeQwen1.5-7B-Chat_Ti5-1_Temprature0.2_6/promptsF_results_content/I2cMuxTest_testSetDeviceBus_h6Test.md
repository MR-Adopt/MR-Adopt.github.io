## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the source input, as it is the same value being set.

## New input pair1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the source input, as it is the same value being set.

## New input pair2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "2";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String deviceBus = "2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the source input, as it is the same value being set.

## New input pair3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "5";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String deviceBus = "5";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the source input, as it is the same value being set.

## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String deviceBus = "3";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, the follow-up input is the same as the source input, as it is the same value being set.
