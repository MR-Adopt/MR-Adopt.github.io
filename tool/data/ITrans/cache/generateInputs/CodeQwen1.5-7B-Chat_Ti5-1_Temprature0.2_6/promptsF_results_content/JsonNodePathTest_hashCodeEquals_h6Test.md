## New input pair0:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("b");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("b");
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two JsonNodePath objects is equal if they have the same parent, pathSegment, pathSegmentIndex, and type. Since the new source input `a1` has the same parent, pathSegment, pathSegmentIndex, and type as `a2`, their hashCodes will be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("a", "b");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("a", "b");
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("a", "b", "c");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("a", "b", "c");

## New input pair3:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("a", "b", "c", "d");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("a", "b", "c", "d");

## New input pair4:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");
