    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);

Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.minusYears(1));
    Class<ZonedDateTime[]> manifest = ZonedDateTime[].class;
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 48, 49, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 44, 34, 50, 48, 49, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 44, 34, 50, 48, 49, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0 };

Explanation:
The inferred relation between the original test case and the method under test is that the method under test is used to serialize and deserialize ZonedDateTime arrays. The source input `jw` and `lts` are used to serialize the ZonedDateTime array into a byte array, and the follow-up input `manifest` and `body` are used to deserialize the byte array back into a ZonedDateTime array. The new source inputs `now.minusYears(1)`, `now.plusMonths(2)`, `now.minusSeconds(5)`, `now.plusHours(3)`, and `now.minusMinutes(10)` are used to create different ZonedDateTime arrays with different years, months, seconds, hours, and minutes, respectively. The follow-up input `body` is generated by serializing the new ZonedDateTime arrays into a byte array using the method under test. The new source inputs satisfy the inferred relation because they create different ZonedDateTime arrays with different years, months, seconds, hours, and minutes, which are different from the original ZonedDateTime array in the original test case.
