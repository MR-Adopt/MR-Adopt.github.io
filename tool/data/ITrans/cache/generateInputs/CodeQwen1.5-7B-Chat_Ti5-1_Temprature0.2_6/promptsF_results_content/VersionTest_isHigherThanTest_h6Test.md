## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.1";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isHigherThan` method should return `false` when comparing two versions. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same, they should not be considered as higher than each other.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isHigherThan` method should return `false` when comparing two versions. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same, they should not be considered as higher than each other.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isHigherThan` method should return `false` when comparing two versions. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same, they should not be considered as higher than each other.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isHigherThan` method should return `false` when comparing two versions. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same, they should not be considered as higher than each other.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "2.1";
    String v2 = "2.1";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `isHigherThan` method should return `false` when comparing two versions. Since `v1` and `v2` are the same, they should not be considered as higher than each other.

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
String v1 = "1.0.1";
String v2 = "1.0.1";
Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
String v1 = "1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.0-A1";
Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0";
String v2 = "1.1.0";
Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```

## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
String v1 = "2.1";
String v2 = "2.1";
Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
assertFalse(a.isHigherThan(b));
```
