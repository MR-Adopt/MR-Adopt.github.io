## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("A durable job").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withDescription("A durable job").build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a durable job and a description. The follow-up input `job22` is the same as the source input `job2Detail`'s job key. The `addJob` method adds the job to the scheduler, and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job detail from the scheduler. The assertions ensure that the job detail retrieved matches the job detail added.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withPriority(5).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withPriority(5).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a durable job and a priority. The follow-up input `job22` is the same as the source input `job2Detail`'s job key. The `addJob` method adds the job to the scheduler, and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job detail from the scheduler. The assertions ensure that the job detail retrieved matches the job detail added.

## New input pair2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTrigger(newTrigger().withIdentity("trigger2", GROUP_KEY).startNow().build()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withTrigger(newTrigger().withIdentity("trigger2", GROUP_KEY).startNow().build()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a durable job and a trigger. The follow-up input `job22` is the same as the source input `job2Detail`'s job key. The `addJob` method adds the job to the scheduler, and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job detail from the scheduler. The assertions ensure that the job detail retrieved matches the job detail added.

## New input pair3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withJobData(new JobDataMap()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withJobData(new JobDataMap()).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a durable job and job data. The follow-up input `job22` is the same as the source input `job2Detail`'s job key. The `addJob` method adds the job to the scheduler, and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job detail from the scheduler. The assertions ensure that the job detail retrieved matches the job detail added.

## New input pair4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withSchedule(cronSchedule("0 0/5 * * *?")).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Generation code:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().withSchedule(cronSchedule("0 0/5 * * *?")).build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
    remoteScheduler.addJob(job2Detail, false);
    assertThat(remoteScheduler.getJobDetail(job22), equalTo(job2Detail));
```
Explanation: The new source input `job2Detail` is created with a durable job and a cron schedule. The follow-up input `job22` is the same as the source input `job2Detail`'s job key. The `addJob` method adds the job to the scheduler, and the `getJobDetail` method retrieves the job detail from the scheduler. The assertions ensure that the job detail retrieved matches the job detail added.
