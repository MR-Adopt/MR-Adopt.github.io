## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation because it adheres to the format "2020-h2".

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h1";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation because it adheres to the format "1900-h1".

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation because it adheres to the format "2000-h2".

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2100-h1";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation because it adheres to the format "2100-h1".

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1800-h2";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text should be in the format "year-hhalf". The new source input pair satisfies this relation because it adheres to the format "1800-h2".
