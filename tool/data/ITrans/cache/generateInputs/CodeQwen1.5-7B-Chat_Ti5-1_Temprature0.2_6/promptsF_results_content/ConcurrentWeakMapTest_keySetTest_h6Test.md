## New input pair0:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(1, 2);
    map.put(2, 3);
    map.put(3, 4);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input0 satisfies the inferred relation because it is a different map with the same key-value pairs as the original `anotherMap`. The `putAll` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` class is called with the new map as the argument, which adds all key-value pairs from the new map to the `map`. The `keySet` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` class is then called, which returns a set of all keys in the `map`. This set is compared with the key set of the new map using the `assertEquals` method from the `Assert` class, which verifies that the two sets are equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(6, 8);
    anotherMap.put(7, 9);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(5, 10);
    map.put(4, 3);
    map.put(3, 7);
    map.put(6, 8);
    map.put(7, 9);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input1 satisfies the inferred relation because it is a different map with the same key-value pairs as the original `anotherMap`. The `putAll` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` class is called with the new map as the argument, which adds all key-value pairs from the new map to the `map`.

    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(5, 6);
    anotherMap.put(4, 5);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(5, 6);
    map.put(3, 6);
    map.put(4, 5);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input2 satisfies the inferred relation because it is a different map with the same key-value pairs as the original `anotherMap`. The `putAll` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` class is called with the new map as the argument, which adds all key-value pairs from the new map to the `map`.

## New input pair3:

    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(null, 10);
    anotherMap.put(null, 3);
    ConcurrentWeakMap<Integer, Integer> map = new ConcurrentWeakMap<>();
    map.put(5, 10);
    map.put(4, 3);
    map.put(3, 7);
    map.put(null, 10);
    map.put(null, 3);
```
### Explanation:
The new source input3 satisfies the inferred relation because it is a different map with the same key-value pairs as the original `anotherMap`. The `putAll` method of the `ConcurrentWeakMap` class is called with the new map as the argument, which adds all key-value pairs from the new map to the `map`.
