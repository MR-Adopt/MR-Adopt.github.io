## New input pair0:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new CustomThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "CustomThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String pluginId = "CustomThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is obtained from the `plugin` object. Since `CustomThreadPoolPlugin` is a subclass of `ThreadPoolPlugin`, it can be registered and retrieved using the `register` and `getPlugin` methods respectively. Therefore, the `pluginId` for `CustomThreadPoolPlugin` is "CustomThreadPoolPlugin".

## New input pair1:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new DefaultThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "DefaultThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String pluginId = "DefaultThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is obtained from the `plugin` object. Since `DefaultThreadPoolPlugin` is a subclass of `ThreadPoolPlugin`, it can be registered and retrieved using the `register` and `getPlugin` methods respectively. Therefore, the `pluginId` for `DefaultThreadPoolPlugin` is "DefaultThreadPoolPlugin".

## New input pair2:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new NullThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = null;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String pluginId = null;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is obtained from the `plugin` object. Since `NullThreadPoolPlugin` is a subclass of `ThreadPoolPlugin`, it can be registered and retrieved using the `register` and `getPlugin` methods respectively. Therefore, the `pluginId` for `NullThreadPoolPlugin` is `null`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new EmptyThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String pluginId = "";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is obtained from the `plugin` object. Since `EmptyThreadPoolPlugin` is a subclass of `ThreadPoolPlugin`, it can be registered and retrieved using the `register` and `getPlugin` methods respectively. Therefore, the `pluginId` for `EmptyThreadPoolPlugin` is an empty string.

## New input pair4:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new InvalidThreadPoolPlugin();
    String pluginId = "InvalidThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String pluginId = "InvalidThreadPoolPlugin";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `pluginId` is obtained from the `plugin` object. Since `InvalidThreadPoolPlugin` is a subclass of `ThreadPoolPlugin`, it can be registered and retrieved using the `register` and `getPlugin` methods respectively. Therefore, the `pluginId` for `InvalidThreadPoolPlugin` is "InvalidThreadPoolPlugin".
