## New input pair0:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `parse` method of the `XmlBuilder` class takes a string input and returns an `XmlBuilder` object. The `parse` method is called with the `XML` string as the input, and the returned `xmlBuilder2` object is assigned to the variable `xmlBuilder2`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `parse` method is the method that takes the source input and produces the follow-up input.

The code used to generate the follow-up input is as follows:
```java
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```
This code calls the `parse` method of the `XmlBuilder` class with the `XML` string as the input, and assigns the returned `XmlBuilder` object to the variable `xmlBuilder2`. This satisfies the inferred relation because the `parse` method is the method that takes the source input and produces the follow-up input.
