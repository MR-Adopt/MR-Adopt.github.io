# REQUIRED DELIVERABLE
## New input pair0:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "medicalModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "medicalModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `symptom` and `symptom2` objects are the same instance, and the `module` and `module2` are the same string. This is because the `addressSource` method is called on the same object `symptom` with the same module name `medicalModule`, which means that the `symptom2` object is also associated with the same module.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String name = "cough";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "clinicalModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "clinicalModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `symptom` and `symptom2` objects are the same instance, and the `module` and `module2` are the same string. This is because the `addressSource` method is called on the same object `symptom` with the same module name `clinicalModule`, which means that the `symptom2` object is also associated with the same module.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String name = "headache";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "physiotherapyModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "physiotherapyModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `symptom` and `symptom2` objects are the same instance, and the `module` and `module2` are the same string. This is because the `addressSource` method is called on the same object `symptom` with the same module name `physiotherapyModule`, which means that the `symptom2` object is also associated with the same module.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String name = "rash";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "dermatologyModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "dermatologyModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `symptom` and `symptom2` objects are the same instance, and the `module` and `module2` are the same string. This is because the `addressSource` method is called on the same object `symptom` with the same module name `dermatologyModule`, which means that the `symptom2` object is also associated with the same module.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String name = "diarrhea";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "nutritionModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "nutritionModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `symptom` and `symptom2` objects are the same instance, and the `module` and `module2` are the same string. This is because the `addressSource` method is called on the same object `symptom` with the same module name `nutritionModule`, which means that the `symptom2` object is also associated with the same module.
