## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Inferred relation: The inferred relation is that the `fromCloseable` method creates a `CloseableResourceHolder` from a given `Closeable` resource.
Justification: The `fromCloseable` method takes a `Closeable` resource as input and returns a `ResourceHolder` that holds the same resource. The `CloseableResourceHolder` class is a subclass of `ResourceHolder` and implements the `Closeable` interface. Therefore, the `fromCloseable` method creates a `CloseableResourceHolder` from the given `Closeable` resource.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = System.out::close;
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = System.out::close;
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
