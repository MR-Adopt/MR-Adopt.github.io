## New input pair0:
```java
    String element2 = "B";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String element2 = "B";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `add` method of the `ORSet` class adds the specified element to the set. Since the `add` method is called with the same element `element2` in the original test case, the inferred relation is that the `add` method should add the element `element2` to the set. Therefore, the follow-up input is `element2`.
