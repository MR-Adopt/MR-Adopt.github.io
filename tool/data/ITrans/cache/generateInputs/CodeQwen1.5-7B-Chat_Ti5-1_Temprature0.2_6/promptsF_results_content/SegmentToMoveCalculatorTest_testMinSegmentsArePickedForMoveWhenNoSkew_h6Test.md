## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the minimum number of segments to move in a tier should be equal to the number of segments to move in the tier when there is no skew. This is because the minimum number of segments to move is calculated based on the total number of segments in the tier, which is the same as the total number of segments to move when there is no skew. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 500_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
int minSegmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier(totalSegmentsInTier);
int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
```

Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1_000_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));

## New input pair3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
