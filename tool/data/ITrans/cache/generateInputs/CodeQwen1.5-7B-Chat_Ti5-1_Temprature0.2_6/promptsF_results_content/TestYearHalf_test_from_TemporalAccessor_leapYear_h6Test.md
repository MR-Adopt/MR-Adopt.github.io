## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    int year = 2008;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
    YearHalf test = YearHalf.from(date);
    assertEquals(YearHalf.of(year, expected), test);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object can be obtained from a `LocalDate` object by calling the `YearHalf.from(date)` method. The `YearHalf.of(year, expected)` method creates a `YearHalf` object with the given year and half-of-year. The `assertEquals` method checks if the two `YearHalf` objects are equal. Since the `YearHalf.from(date)` method returns a `YearHalf` object with the same year and half-of-year as the `YearHalf.of(year, expected)` method, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
