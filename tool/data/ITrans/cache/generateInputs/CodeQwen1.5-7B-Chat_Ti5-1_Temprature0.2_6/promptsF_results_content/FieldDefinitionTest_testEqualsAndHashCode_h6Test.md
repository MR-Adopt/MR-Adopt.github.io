## New input pair0:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `name` field of the `FieldDefinition` class should be the same in both. Since the source input has an empty string as the name, the follow-up input also has an empty string as the name. The `deprecated` field is also the same in both, as it is not affected by the `name` field.

## New input pair1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("123", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("123", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("123", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `name` field of the `FieldDefinition` class should be the same in both. Since the source input has a string of digits as the name, the follow-up input also has a string of digits as the name. The `deprecated` field is also the same in both, as it is not affected by the `name` field.

## New input pair2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo123", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo123", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo123", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `name` field of the `FieldDefinition` class should be the same in both. Since the source input has a string of alphanumeric characters as the name, the follow-up input also has a string of alphanumeric characters as the name. The `deprecated` field is also the same in both, as it is not affected by the `name` field.

## New input pair3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo_bar", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo_bar", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo_bar", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `name` field of the `FieldDefinition` class should be the same in both. Since the source input has a string containing underscores as the name, the follow-up input also has a string containing underscores as the name. The `deprecated` field is also the same in both, as it is not affected by the `name` field.

## New input pair4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("FOO", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("FOO", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("FOO", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `name` field of the `FieldDefinition` class should be the same in both. Since the source input has a string of uppercase letters as the name, the follow-up input also has a string of uppercase letters as the name. The `deprecated` field is also the same in both, as it is not affected by the `name` field.
