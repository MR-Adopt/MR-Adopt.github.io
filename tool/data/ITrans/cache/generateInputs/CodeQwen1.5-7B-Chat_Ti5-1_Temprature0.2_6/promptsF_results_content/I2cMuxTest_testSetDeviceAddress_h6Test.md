## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device address of `i2cMux` should update the device address of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, when `i2cMux` is set with a new device address, `i2cMux2` should also be set with the same device address.

```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
