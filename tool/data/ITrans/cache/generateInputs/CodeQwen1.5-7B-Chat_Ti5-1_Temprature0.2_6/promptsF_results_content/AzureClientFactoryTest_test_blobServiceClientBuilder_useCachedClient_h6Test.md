## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation: Since `retryCount1` is not null, it will be used as the key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map. The `getBlobServiceClient` method will compute the value for this key by calling the `buildNewClient` method. The `buildNewClient` method will use the `retryCount1` value to determine the number of retries for the client. Since `retryCount1` is 5, the client will have 5 retries. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are the same, so the computed value for the key in the map will be the same for both inputs.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation: Since `retryCount1` is 0, it will be used as the key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map. The `getBlobServiceClient` method will compute the value for this key by calling the `buildNewClient` method. The `buildNewClient` method will use the `retryCount1` value to determine the number of retries for the client. Since `retryCount1` is 0, the client will have 0 retries. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are the same, so the computed value for the key in the map will be the same for both inputs.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation: Since `retryCount1` is not null, it will be used as the key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map. The `getBlobServiceClient` method will compute the value for this key by calling the `buildNewClient` method. The `buildNewClient` method will use the `retryCount1` value to determine the number of retries for the client. Since `retryCount1` is 10, the client will have 10 retries. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are the same, so the computed value for the key in the map will be the same for both inputs.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation: Since `retryCount1` is null, it will be used as the key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map. The `getBlobServiceClient` method will compute the value for this key by calling the `buildNewClient` method. The `buildNewClient` method will use the `config.getMaxTries()` value to determine the number of retries for the client. Since `retryCount1` is null, the client will have the default number of retries specified in the `config` object. The `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` values are the same, so the computed value for the key in the map will be the same for both inputs.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
```
Explanation: Since `retryCount1` is null, it will be used as the key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map. The `getBlobServiceClient` method will compute the value for this key by calling the `buildNewClient` method.
