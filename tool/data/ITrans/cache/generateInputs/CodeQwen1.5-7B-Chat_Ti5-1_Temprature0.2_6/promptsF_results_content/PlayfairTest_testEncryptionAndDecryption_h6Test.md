## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRET");
    String plaintext = "HELLO";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is the same as the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to encrypt the plaintext using the same PlayfairCipher object.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAM";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is the same as the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to encrypt the plaintext using the same PlayfairCipher object.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("12345");
    String plaintext = "67890";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is the same as the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to encrypt the plaintext using the same PlayfairCipher object.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("ABCDE");
    String plaintext = "FGHIJ";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is the same as the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to encrypt the plaintext using the same PlayfairCipher object.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("XYZ");
    String plaintext = "ABC";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the encrypted text is the same as the decrypted text. Therefore, to satisfy this relation, we need to encrypt the plaintext using the same PlayfairCipher object.
