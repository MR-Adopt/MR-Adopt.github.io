## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. Therefore, to generate the follow-up input, we can use the `toString()` method of the YearHalf object to obtain the text representation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H2";
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 3;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H3";
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 3;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

Therefore, to generate the follow-up input, we can use the `toString()` method of the YearHalf object to obtain the text representation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 0;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H0";
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 0;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the text representation of a YearHalf object is the concatenation of the year and half-of-year in the format "YYYY-HX", where X is the half-of-year represented as a single digit. Therefore, to generate the follow-up input, we can use the `toString()` method of the YearHalf object to obtain the text representation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = -1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H-1";
```
## Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = -1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
