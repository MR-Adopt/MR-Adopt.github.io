## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the source input is an element with a different key and the same bias as the original element. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to this same key and bias.
