## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to 0, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with these inputs should be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to 10, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with these inputs should be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to -1, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with these inputs should be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with these inputs should be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Generation code:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with the same `retryCount` and `storageAccount` should be equal. Since `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are both set to `null`, the `BlobServiceClient` instances created with these inputs should be equal.
