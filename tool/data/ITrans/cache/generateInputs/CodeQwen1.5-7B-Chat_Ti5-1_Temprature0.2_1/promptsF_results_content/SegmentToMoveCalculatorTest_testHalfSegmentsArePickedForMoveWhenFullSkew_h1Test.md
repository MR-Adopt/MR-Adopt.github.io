## New input pair0:
```java
    String tier = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `tier` and `historicals` are related to the `tier2` and `historicals2` in the original test case. The `tier` and `historicals` are used to calculate the number of segments to move to fix skew, while the `tier2` and `historicals2` are used to calculate the number of segments to move in the tier. Since the `tier` and `historicals` are the same as the `tier2` and `historicals2` in the original test case, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String tier = "tier3";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier3";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
