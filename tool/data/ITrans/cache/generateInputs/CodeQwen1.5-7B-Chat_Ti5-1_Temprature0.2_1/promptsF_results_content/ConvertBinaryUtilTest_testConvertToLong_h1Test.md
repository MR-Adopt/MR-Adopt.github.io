## New input pair0:
```java
    String randomString = "0";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 48 };
```
Explanation: The new source input `randomString` is "0", which is a single byte representing the decimal value 48. The corresponding follow-up input `randomStringBytes` is an array of bytes with a single element 48, which is the UTF-8 encoding of the character '0'. This satisfies the inferred relation that the output of `convertStringToLong` and `convertBytesToLong` should be equal for the same input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String randomString = "9223372036854775807";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 0x7f, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff };
```
Explanation: The new source input `randomString` is "9223372036854775807", which is the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit signed integer. The corresponding follow-up input `randomStringBytes` is an array of bytes with eight elements 0x7f, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, which is the UTF-8 encoding of the string "9223372036854775807". This satisfies the inferred relation that the output of `convertStringToLong` and `convertBytesToLong` should be equal for the same input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String randomString = "-1";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff };
```
Explanation: The new source input `randomString` is "-1", which is the minimum value that can be represented by a 64-bit signed integer. The corresponding follow-up input `randomStringBytes` is an array of bytes with eight elements 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, which is the UTF-8 encoding of the string "-1". This satisfies the inferred relation that the output of `convertStringToLong` and `convertBytesToLong` should be equal for the same input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String randomString = "1";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 49 };
```
Explanation: The new source input `randomString` is "1", which is a single byte representing the decimal value 49. The corresponding follow-up input `randomStringBytes` is an array of bytes with a single element 49, which is the UTF-8 encoding of the character '1'. This satisfies the inferred relation that the output of `convertStringToLong` and `convertBytesToLong` should be equal for the same input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String randomString = "1234567890123456789";
    byte[] randomStringBytes = { 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 };
```
Explanation: The new source input `randomString` is "1234567890123456789", which is a string of 18 digits. The corresponding follow-up input `randomStringBytes` is an array of bytes with 18 elements 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, which is the UTF-8 encoding of the string "1234567890123456789". This satisfies the inferred relation that the output of `convertStringToLong` and `convertBytesToLong` should be equal for the same input.
