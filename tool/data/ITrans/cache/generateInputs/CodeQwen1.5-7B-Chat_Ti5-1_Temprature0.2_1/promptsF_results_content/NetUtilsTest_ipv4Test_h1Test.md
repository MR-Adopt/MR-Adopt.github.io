## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.1.1";
    long ipLong2 = 3232235777L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` returns the long representation of the IP address. Since `ipStr1` is "192.168.1.1", the long representation is `3232235777L`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 167772161L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` returns the long representation of the IP address. Since `ipStr1` is "10.0.0.1", the long representation is `167772161L`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 2886723584L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` returns the long representation of the IP address. Since `ipStr1` is "172.16.0.1", the long representation is `2886723584L`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "8.8.8.8";
    long ipLong2 = 134744072L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` returns the long representation of the IP address. Since `ipStr1` is "8.8.8.8", the long representation is `134744072L`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "255.255.255.255";
    long ipLong2 = 4294967295L;
```
Generation code:
```java
long ipLong2 = ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between `ipStr1` and `ipLong2` is that `ipv4ToLong(ipStr1)` returns the long representation of the IP address. Since `ipStr1` is "255.255.255.255", the long representation is `4294967295L`.
