## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)`. Since `half1` is 1 and `half2` is 2, the `withHalf` method should return a `YearHalf` object with `year1` and `half2`. Therefore, `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(2020, 2)`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)`. Since `half1` is 2 and `half2` is 1, the `withHalf` method should return a `YearHalf` object with `year1` and `half1`. Therefore, `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(2020, 1)`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)`. Since `half1` is 1 and `half2` is 1, the `withHalf` method should return a `YearHalf` object with `year1` and `half1`. Therefore, `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(2020, 1)`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)`. Since `half1` is 2 and `half2` is 2, the `withHalf` method should return a `YearHalf` object with `year1` and `half2`. Therefore, `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(2020, 2)`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 3;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 3;
```
## Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 3;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 3;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)`. Since `half1` is 1 and `half2` is 3, the `withHalf` method should return a `YearHalf` object with `year1` and `half2`. However, there is no `Half` enum value for 3, so the `withHalf` method should throw an exception. Therefore, `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should not be equal to any `YearHalf` object.
