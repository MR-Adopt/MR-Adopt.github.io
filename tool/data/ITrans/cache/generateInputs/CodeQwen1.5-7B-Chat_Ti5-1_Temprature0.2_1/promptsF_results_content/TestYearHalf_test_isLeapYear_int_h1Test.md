## New input pair0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 0;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` should be created using the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `half` value as the source input and the `year` value set to 0. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same half value and year value as the source input, and it passes the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` should be created using the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `half` value as the source input and the `year` value set to 1000. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same half value and year value as the source input, and it passes the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 4000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` should be created using the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `half` value as the source input and the `year` value set to 4000. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same half value and year value as the source input, and it passes the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 5000;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` should be created using the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `half` value as the source input and the `year` value set to 5000. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same half value and year value as the source input, and it passes the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = -1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `YearHalf` object `test2` should be created using the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `half` value as the source input and the `year` value set to -1. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same half value and year value as the source input, and it passes the assertions in the original test case.
