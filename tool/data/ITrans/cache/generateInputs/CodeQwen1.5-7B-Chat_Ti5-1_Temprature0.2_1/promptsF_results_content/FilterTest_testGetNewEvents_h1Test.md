## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This will result in the same event being returned by the getNewEvents method of filter2, which will pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "", "Description2");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event2", "", "Description2");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This will result in the same event being returned by the getNewEvents method of filter2, which will pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This will result in the same event being returned by the getNewEvents method of filter2, which will pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adds the same mockEvent to both filter and filter2. This will result in the same event being returned by the getNewEvents method of filter2, which will pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
