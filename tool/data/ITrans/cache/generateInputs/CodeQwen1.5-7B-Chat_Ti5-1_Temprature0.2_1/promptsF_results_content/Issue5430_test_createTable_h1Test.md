## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the original SQL statement is being normalized to match the expected format. The normalization process involves removing unnecessary whitespace, replacing single quotes with double quotes, and adjusting the column definition syntax. The new SQL statement maintains the same table name, column names, and data type, but uses the expected format for the column definition. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same normalization process as the original test case.
