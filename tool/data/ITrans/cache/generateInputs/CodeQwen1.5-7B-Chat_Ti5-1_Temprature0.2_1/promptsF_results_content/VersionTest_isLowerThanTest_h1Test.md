## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "0.9";
    String v2 = "0.91";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case checks if `v1` is lower than `v2`, and `0.9` is less than `0.91`, we can infer that `v1` should be lower than `v2`. Therefore, we can use `0.91` as the follow-up input for `v2`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1";
    String v2 = "1.2";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case checks if `v1` is lower than `v2`, and `1.1` is less than `1.2`, we can infer that `v1` should be lower than `v2`. Therefore, we can use `1.2` as the follow-up input for `v2`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A2";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case checks if `v1` is lower than `v2`, and `1.0-A1` is less than `1.0-A2`, we can infer that `v1` should be lower than `v2`. Therefore, we can use `1.0-A2` as the follow-up input for `v2`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case checks if `v1` is lower than `v2`, and `1.0.0` is less than `1.0.1`, we can infer that `v1` should be lower than `v2`. Therefore, we can use `1.0.1` as the follow-up input for `v2`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A2";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case checks if `v1` is lower than `v2`, and `1.0.0-A1` is less than `1.0.0-A2`, we can infer that `v1` should be lower than `v2`. Therefore, we can use `1.0.0-A2` as the follow-up input for `v2`.
