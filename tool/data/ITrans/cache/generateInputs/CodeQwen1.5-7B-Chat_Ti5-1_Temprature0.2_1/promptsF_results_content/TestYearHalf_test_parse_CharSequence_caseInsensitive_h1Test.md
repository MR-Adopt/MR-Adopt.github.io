## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text representation of a `YearHalf` object should be the same as the text representation of the `YearHalf` object created using the `of` method. Since the `toString` method of a `YearHalf` object returns the text representation of the year and half in the format "yyyy-hH", the text representation of the `YearHalf` object created using the `of` method should be the same as the text representation of the `YearHalf` object created using the `toString` method.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-h1";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java

    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2100-h1";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java

    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1800-h2";
```
### Code used to generate the follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1800;

    CharSequence text = YearHalf.of(year, half).toString();
