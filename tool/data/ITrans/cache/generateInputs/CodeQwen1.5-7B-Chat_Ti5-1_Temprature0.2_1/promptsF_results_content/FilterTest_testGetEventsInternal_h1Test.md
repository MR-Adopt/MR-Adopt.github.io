## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```

Explanation: In this new input pair, we create a new `Filter` object `filter` and add `mockEvent1` to it. Then, we create another `Filter` object `filter2` and add `mockEvent1` to it as well. Since `filter` and `filter2` are two different objects, their internal events lists are not the same, hence the assertion `assertNotSame(events, filter2.getEventsInternal())` passes.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent3);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent3);
```

Explanation: In this new input pair, we create a new `Filter` object `filter` and add `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`, and `mockEvent3` to it. Then, we create another `Filter` object `filter2` and add `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`, and `mockEvent3` to it as well. Since `filter` and `filter2` are two different objects, their internal events lists are not the same, hence the assertion `assertNotSame(events, filter2.getEventsInternal())` passes.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```

Explanation: In this new input pair, we create a new `Filter` object `filter` and a new `Filter` object `filter2`. Since `filter` and `filter2` are two different objects, their internal events lists are not the same, hence the assertion `assertNotSame(events, filter2.getEventsInternal())` passes.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Explanation: In this new input pair, we create a new `Filter` object `filter` and add `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2` to it. Then, we create another `Filter` object `filter2` and add `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2` to it as well.
