## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, we create a new instance of `i2cMux` and set its device bus to "0". Then, we create another instance of `i2cMux` and assert that its device bus is equal to the device bus of the first instance.

## New input pair1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, we create a new instance of `i2cMux` and set its device bus to "7". Then, we create another instance of `i2cMux` and assert that its device bus is equal to the device bus of the first instance.

## New input pair2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, we create a new instance of `i2cMux` and set its device bus to "8". Then, we create another instance of `i2cMux` and assert that its device bus is equal to the device bus of the first instance.

## New input pair3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "-1";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, we create a new instance of `i2cMux` and set its device bus to "-1". Then, we create another instance of `i2cMux` and assert that its device bus is equal to the device bus of the first instance.

## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "abc";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
    assertEquals(deviceBus, i2cMux2.getDeviceBus());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device bus of `i2cMux` should update the device bus of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, we create a new instance of `i2cMux` and set its device bus to "abc". Then, we create another instance of `i2cMux` and assert that its device bus is equal to the device bus of the first instance.
