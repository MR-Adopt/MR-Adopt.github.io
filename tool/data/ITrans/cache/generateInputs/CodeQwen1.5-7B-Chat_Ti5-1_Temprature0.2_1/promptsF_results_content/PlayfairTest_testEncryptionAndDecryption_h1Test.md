## New input pair0:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("SECRETKEY");
    String plaintext = "HELLOWORLD";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The new source input0 satisfies the inferred relation because it uses a different keyword "SECRETKEY" compared to the original source input. The encrypted text "textTodecrypt" is generated by encrypting the "HELLOWORLD" plaintext with the "SECRETKEY" keyword.

## New input pair1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("JAVA");
    String plaintext = "JAVA";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The new source input1 satisfies the inferred relation because it uses a different keyword "JAVA" compared to the original source input. The encrypted text "textTodecrypt" is generated by encrypting the "JAVA" plaintext with the "JAVA" keyword.

## New input pair2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("LONGKEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "SHORTTEXT";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The new source input2 satisfies the inferred relation because it uses a different keyword "LONGKEYWORD" compared to the original source input. The encrypted text "textTodecrypt" is generated by encrypting the "SHORTTEXT" plaintext with the "LONGKEYWORD" keyword.

## New input pair3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "J";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The new source input3 satisfies the inferred relation because it uses the same keyword "KEYWORD" as the original source input. The encrypted text "textTodecrypt" is generated by encrypting the "J" plaintext with the "KEYWORD" keyword.

## New input pair4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JJ";
    String textTodecrypt = playfairCipher.encrypt(plaintext);
```
Explanation: The new source input4 satisfies the inferred relation because it uses the same keyword "KEYWORD" as the original source input. The encrypted text "textTodecrypt" is generated by encrypting the "JJ" plaintext with the "KEYWORD" keyword.
