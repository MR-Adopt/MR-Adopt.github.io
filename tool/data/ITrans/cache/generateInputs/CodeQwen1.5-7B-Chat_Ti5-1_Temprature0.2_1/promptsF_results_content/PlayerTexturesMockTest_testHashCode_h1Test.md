## Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both `playerTexturesMock` and `otherPlayerTexturesMock` should have the same hash code. This is because the `hashCode()` method of `PlayerTexturesMock` is based on the `ProfileProperty` object obtained from the `getProperty()` method, which is set using the `setProperty()` method. If the `ProfileProperty` objects are equal, their hash codes should also be equal.

For the new source inputs, we create new `PlayerTexturesMock` objects with the same skin URL and set the same `ProfileProperty` object using the `setProperty()` method. This ensures that the hash codes of the two objects are equal, as required by the original test case.
