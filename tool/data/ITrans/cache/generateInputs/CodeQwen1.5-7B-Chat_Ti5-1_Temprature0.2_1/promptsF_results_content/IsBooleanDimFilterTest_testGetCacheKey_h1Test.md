## New input pair0:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Generation code:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the cache keys of `f1_3` and `f1_4` should be the same. Since `f3` and `f4` have the same field name ("y"), column type (STRING), value ("hello"), and filter (null), their cache keys should also be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
Generation code:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the cache keys of `f1_3` and `f1_4` should be the same. Since `f3` and `f4` have the same field name ("x"), column type (INTEGER), value ("hello"), and filter (null), their cache keys should also be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Generation code:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the cache keys of `f1_3` and `f1_4` should be the same. Since `f3` and `f4` have the same field name ("x"), column type (STRING), value ("world"), and filter (null), their cache keys should also be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Generation code:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the cache keys of `f1_3` and `f1_4` should be the same. Since `f3` and `f4` have the same field name ("x"), column type (STRING), value ("hello"), and filter ("world"), their cache keys should also be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "null");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "null");
```
Generation code:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "null");
