## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2021;
    int year3 = 2021;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int year3 = 2022;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int year3 = 2023;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2024;
    int year3 = 2024;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2025;
    int year3 = 2025;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input for new source input pair0:
```java
int year1 = 2020;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2021;
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input for new source input pair1:
```java
int year1 = 2020;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2022;
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input for new source input pair2:
```java
int year1 = 2020;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2023;
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input for new source input pair3:
```java
int year1 = 2020;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2024;
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input for new source input pair4:
```java
int year1 = 2020;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2025;
int year3 = year1;
int half3 = half1;
```

The inferred relation is that the `year3` and `half3` should be the same as `year1` and `half1` respectively, as the `with` method of `YearHalf` class does not modify the year or half-of-year. Therefore, for each new source input pair, we simply assign the same values to `year3` and `half3` as `year1` and `half1` respectively.
