## New input pair0:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input0 creates a new `FieldDefinition` object with an empty string as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type. The new `FieldDefinition` object is then compared with the `other3` object, which also has an empty string as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type, but it is deprecated. Since the `deprecated` field is not considered in the `hashCode()` method, the hash codes of the two objects will be the same, which violates the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", null);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", null).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input1 creates a new `FieldDefinition` object with "foo" as the name and `null` as the type. The new `FieldDefinition` object is then compared with the `other3` object, which also has "foo" as the name and `null` as the type, but it is deprecated. Since the `deprecated` field is not considered in the `hashCode()` method, the hash codes of the two objects will be the same, which violates the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input2 creates a new `FieldDefinition` object with "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it is deprecated. The new `FieldDefinition` object is then compared with the `other3` object, which also has "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it is deprecated. Since the `deprecated` field is considered in the `hashCode()` method, the hash codes of the two objects will be the same, which satisfies the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description").deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input3 creates a new `FieldDefinition` object with "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it has a description. The new `FieldDefinition` object is then compared with the `other3` object, which also has "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it has a description, but it is deprecated. Since the `deprecated` field is considered in the `hashCode()` method, the hash codes of the two objects will be the same, which satisfies the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setExample("example");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setExample("example").deprecate();
```
Explanation: The new source input4 creates a new `FieldDefinition` object with "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it has an example. The new `FieldDefinition` object is then compared with the `other3` object, which also has "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it has an example, but it is deprecated. Since the `deprecated` field is considered in the `hashCode()` method, the hash codes of the two objects will be the same, which satisfies the assertion in the original test case.
