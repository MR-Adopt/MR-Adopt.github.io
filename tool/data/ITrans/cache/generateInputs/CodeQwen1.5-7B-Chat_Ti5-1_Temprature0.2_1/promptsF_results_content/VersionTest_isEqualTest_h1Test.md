## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should not be equal. Since `v1` is "1.0-A1" and `v2` is "1.0-A1", they are equal, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should not be equal. Since `v1` is "1.1.0" and `v2` is "1.1.0", they are equal, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should not be equal. Since `v1` is "1.1.0-A1" and `v2` is "1.1.0-A1", they are equal, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should not be equal. Since `v1` is "1.0.0-A1" and `v2` is "1.0.0-A1", they are equal, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0.A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0.A1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `v1` and `v2` should not be equal. Since `v1` is "1.0.0.A1" and `v2` is "1.0.0.A1", they are equal, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
