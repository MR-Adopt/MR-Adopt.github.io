## New input pair1:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The new input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation because it is the same as the original source input `XML`. The `parse` method in the `XmlBuilder` class takes a string input and returns an `XmlBuilder` object. Since the original source input `XML` is passed to the `parse` method, the resulting `xmlBuilder2` object will be the same as the original `xmlBuilder` object. Therefore, when `xmlBuilder2.asString()` is called, it will return the same string as `XML`. This satisfies the assertion in the original test case.
