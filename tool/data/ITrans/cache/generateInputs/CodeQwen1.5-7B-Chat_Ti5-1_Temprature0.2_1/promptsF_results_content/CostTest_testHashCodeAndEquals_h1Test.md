## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be different if their values are different. Since the value of `subject` is 0 and the value of `other` is 1, their hashCodes should be different.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(101);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be different if their values are different. Since the value of `subject` is 100 and the value of `other` is 101, their hashCodes should be different.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be different if their values are different. Since the value of `subject` is -1 and the value of `other` is -2, their hashCodes should be different.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(50);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(51);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be different if their values are different. Since the value of `subject` is 50 and the value of `other` is 51, their hashCodes should be different.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(999);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be different if their values are different. Since the value of `subject` is 999 and the value of `other` is 1000, their hashCodes should be different.
