## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = true;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = true;
```
### Explanation:
The new source input `l = 0` satisfies the inferred relation with the original test case. The original test case does not have any assertions for the follow-up input `l2` and `b`, so we can infer that these values are not relevant to the test case. Therefore, we can use the same values `l2 = 0` and `b = true` as the follow-up input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The new source input `l = -1` satisfies the inferred relation with the original test case. The original test case does not have any assertions for the follow-up input `l2` and `b`, so we can infer that these values are not relevant to the test case. Therefore, we can use the same values `l2 = -1` and `b = false` as the follow-up input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = true;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = true;
```
### Explanation:
The new source input `l = Long.MAX_VALUE` satisfies the inferred relation with the original test case. The original test case does not have any assertions for the follow-up input `l2` and `b`, so we can infer that these values are not relevant to the test case. Therefore, we can use the same values `l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE` and `b = true` as the follow-up input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
    long l2 = 500000000;
    boolean b = true;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
    long l2 = 500000000;
    boolean b = true;
```
### Explanation:
The new source input `l = 500000000` satisfies the inferred relation with the original test case. The original test case does not have any assertions for the follow-up input `l2` and `b`, so we can infer that these values are not relevant to the test case. Therefore, we can use the same values `l2 = 500000000` and `b = true` as the follow-up input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = -500000000;
    long l2 = -500000000;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    long l = -500000000;
    long l2 = -500000000;
    boolean b = false;
```
### Explanation:
The new source input `l = -500000000` satisfies the inferred relation with the original test case. The original test case does not have any assertions for the follow-up input `l2` and `b`, so we can infer that these values are not relevant to the test case. Therefore, we can use the same values `l2 = -500000000` and `b = false` as the follow-up input.
