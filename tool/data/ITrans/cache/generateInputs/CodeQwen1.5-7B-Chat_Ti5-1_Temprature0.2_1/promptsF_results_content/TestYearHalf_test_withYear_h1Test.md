## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2030;
    int year3 = 2030;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2030;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getHalf().getValue();
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `withYear` method of `YearHalf` class should return a new `YearHalf` object with the specified year. The new `YearHalf` object is obtained by calling the `withYear` method on the original `YearHalf` object with the specified year. The `getYear` and `getHalf` methods are used to obtain the year and half of the new `YearHalf` object, respectively. The new `YearHalf` object is then compared with the expected `YearHalf` object using the `assertEquals` method.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getYear();
    int half3 = YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2).getHalf().getValue();
