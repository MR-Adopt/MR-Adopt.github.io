## New input pair0:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when acquiring from the same pool. Since the threadProbe.index() method returns the index of the current thread in a thread-safe manner, and the index is always 0 for a single-threaded pool, the new input pair satisfies this relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when acquiring from the same pool. Since the threadProbe.index() method returns the index of the current thread in a thread-safe manner, and the index is always 0 for a single-threaded pool, the new input pair satisfies this relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when acquiring from the same pool. Since the threadProbe.index() method returns the index of the current thread in a thread-safe manner, and the index is always 0 for a single-threaded pool, the new input pair satisfies this relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when acquiring from the same pool. Since the threadProbe.index() method returns the index of the current thread in a thread-safe manner, and the index is always 0 for a single-threaded pool, the new input pair satisfies this relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(5);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(5);
```

Since the threadProbe.index() method returns the index of the current thread in a thread-safe manner, and the index is always 0 for a single-threaded pool, the new input pair satisfies this relation.
