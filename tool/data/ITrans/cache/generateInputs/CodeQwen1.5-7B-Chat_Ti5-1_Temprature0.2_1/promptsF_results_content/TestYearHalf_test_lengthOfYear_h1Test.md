# New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 2);
```
Generation code:
```java
int year = 2020;
Half half = Half.H2;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the length of the year is determined by the year and half-of-year. Since the year 2020 is a leap year, the length of the year is 366. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is constructed with the year 2020 and half-of-year 2, which satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 1);
```
Generation code:
```java
int year = 1900;
Half half = Half.H1;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the length of the year is determined by the year and half-of-year. Since the year 1900 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is constructed with the year 1900 and half-of-year 1, which satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 2);
```
Generation code:
```java
int year = 2000;
Half half = Half.H2;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the length of the year is determined by the year and half-of-year. Since the year 2000 is a leap year, the length of the year is 366. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is constructed with the year 2000 and half-of-year 2, which satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1600;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1600, 1);
```
Generation code:
```java
int year = 1600;
Half half = Half.H1;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the length of the year is determined by the year and half-of-year. Since the year 1600 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is constructed with the year 1600 and half-of-year 1, which satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 0;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(0, 2);
```
Generation code:
```java
int year = 0;
Half half = Half.H2;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the length of the year is determined by the year and half-of-year. Since the year 0 is not a leap year, the length of the year is 365. Therefore, the follow-up input `test2` is constructed with the year 0 and half-of-year 2, which satisfies the inferred relation.
