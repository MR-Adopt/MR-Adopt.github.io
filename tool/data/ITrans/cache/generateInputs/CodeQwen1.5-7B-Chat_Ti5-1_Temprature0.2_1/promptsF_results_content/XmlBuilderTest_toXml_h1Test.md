# New input pair1:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `parse` method of the `XmlBuilder` class takes an XML string as input and returns an `XmlBuilder` object. The `toXml` method of the `XmlBuilder` class takes no input and returns an XML string. The `assertEquals` assertion in the original test case compares the XML string returned by the `toXml` method of the `xmlBuilder2` object with the XML string passed to the `parse` method of the `xmlBuilder2` object. Since the `parse` method of the `XmlBuilder` class is called with the same XML string as the one passed to the `parse` method of the `xmlBuilder2` object, the XML string returned by the `toXml` method of the `xmlBuilder2` object should be the same as the original XML string. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
