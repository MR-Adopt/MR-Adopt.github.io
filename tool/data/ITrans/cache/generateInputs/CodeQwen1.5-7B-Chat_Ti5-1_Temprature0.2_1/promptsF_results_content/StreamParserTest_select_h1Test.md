## New input pair0:
```java
    StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
    String queryTitle = "p";
    String queryTitle2 = "p";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `queryTitle2` should be the same as `queryTitle` because the `expectFirst` method is used to find the first matching element based on the provided query. Since the original test case is testing the `selectFirst` method, we can infer that the `queryTitle2` should be the same as `queryTitle` to ensure that the method under test is working as expected.

## New input pair1:
```java
    StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
    String queryTitle = "h1";
    String queryTitle2 = "h1";

## New input pair4:
