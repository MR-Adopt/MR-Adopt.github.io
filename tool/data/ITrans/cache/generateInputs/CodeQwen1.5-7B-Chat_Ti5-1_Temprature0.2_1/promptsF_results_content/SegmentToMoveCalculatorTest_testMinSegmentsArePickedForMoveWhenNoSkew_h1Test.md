## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the `totalSegmentsInTier` should be the same for both. This is because the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method is called with the `totalSegmentsInTier` as the input, and the result is compared with the `segmentsToMove` calculated in the original test case. Since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 0, the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will return the minimum value, which is also 0. Therefore, the `segmentsToMove` calculated in the original test case will also be 0, and the assertion will pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

Since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 1, the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will return the minimum value, which is also 1. Therefore, the `segmentsToMove` calculated in the original test case will also be 1, and the assertion will pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
