## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Explanation:
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same structure and operations as the original test case. The `job2Detail` is created using the same method and parameters as in the original test case, and the `job22` is created using the same method and parameters as in the original test case. The `job2Detail` and `job22` are used in the assertions of the original test case to verify the correctness of the `addJob` and `getJobDetail` methods of the `METHOD UNDER TEST`.
