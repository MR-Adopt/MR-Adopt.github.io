# New input pair0:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
    String key2 = "key1";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `nameState` and `nameState2` are the same object, so if we add a next name state to `nameState` using the key `key`, we should be able to retrieve the same next name state from `nameState2` using the same key `key2`.
