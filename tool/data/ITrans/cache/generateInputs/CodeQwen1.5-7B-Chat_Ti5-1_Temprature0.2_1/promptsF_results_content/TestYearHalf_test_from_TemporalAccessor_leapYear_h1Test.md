## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, 7, 15);
int year = 2020;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is determined by the month value of the date. For the given date, the month value is 7, so the expected half-of-year is 2.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2019;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2019, 12, 31);
int year = 2019;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is determined by the month value of the date. For the given date, the month value is 12, so the expected half-of-year is 2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2021, 1, 1);
int year = 2021;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is determined by the month value of the date. For the given date, the month value is 1, so the expected half-of-year is 1.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 6, 30);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is determined by the month value of the date. For the given date, the month value is 6, so the expected half-of-year is 2.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2023;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2023, 7, 1);
int year = 2023;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year-half is determined by the month value of the date. For the given date, the month value is 7, so the expected half-of-year is 2.
