## New input pair0:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the group and partition of requestKey1 are the same as requestKey2, and the offset of requestKey1 is 0, the hashCode of requestKey1 is equal to the hashCode of requestKey2.

## New input pair1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the group and partition of requestKey1 are the same as requestKey2, and the offset of requestKey1 is 0, the hashCode of requestKey1 is equal to the hashCode of requestKey2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("", 0, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the group of requestKey1 is the same as the group of requestKey2, and the partition and offset of requestKey1 are 0, the hashCode of requestKey1 is equal to the hashCode of requestKey2.

## New input pair3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, -1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the group and partition of requestKey1 are the same as requestKey2, and the offset of requestKey1 is -1, the hashCode of requestKey1 is equal to the hashCode of requestKey2.

## New input pair4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", -1, 0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two InFlightRequestKey objects is equal if and only if their group, partition, and offset are equal. Since the group and partition of requestKey1 are the same as requestKey2, and the offset of requestKey1 is -1, the hashCode of requestKey1 is equal to the hashCode of requestKey2.
