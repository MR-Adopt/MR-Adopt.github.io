## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the SQL statement should be normalized to remove any unnecessary whitespace and formatting. The normalization process involves replacing various whitespace characters with a single space, removing extraneous parentheses, and replacing commas with spaces.

To generate the follow-up input, the original SQL statement was passed through the `normalizeSql` method, which performs the normalization process. The resulting normalized SQL statement was then assigned to the `newSql` variable.

The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it contains the normalized SQL statement as the follow-up input, which is identical to the original SQL statement after normalization. This ensures that the assertions in the original test case will pass, as the normalized SQL statements are identical.
