## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```

Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the `setDeviceAddress` method of the `I2cMux` class sets the device address of the i2cMux device and the `getDeviceAddress` method returns the current device address. Therefore, for each new source input, we create a new instance of `I2cMux` and set the device address using the `setDeviceAddress` method. We then compare the device address returned by the `getDeviceAddress` method with the expected device address using the `assertEquals` method. This ensures that the `setDeviceAddress` method works as intended and that the device address is correctly set and retrieved.
