## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `expected` values are derived from the `date` object. The `date` object is obtained from the `LocalDate.of(2007, 1, 1)` method, which represents a specific date. The `expected` value is calculated by dividing the month value of the `date` object minus 1 by 6 and adding 1. This calculation is performed using the `getMonthValue()` method of the `date` object. The `year` value is simply set to 2007.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `expected` values are derived from the `date` object. The `date` object is obtained from the `LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1)` method, which represents a specific date. The `expected` value is calculated by dividing the month value of the `date` object minus 1 by 6 and adding 1. This calculation is performed using the `getMonthValue()` method of the `date` object. The `year` value is simply set to 2020.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
    int year = 2007;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
