## New input pair0:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 34, 44, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 30;
```
Explanation: The new source input0 creates a LocalTime object with the value "00:00:00". The corresponding follow-up input creates a JsonWriter and a LocalTime array with the same value. The byte array `body` represents the serialized JSON representation of the LocalTime array, where each time is represented as a string in the format "HH:mm:ss". The size of the byte array is 30, which corresponds to the length of the serialized JSON string.

## New input pair1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 51, 58, 53, 57, 58, 53, 57, 34, 44, 34, 50, 51, 58, 53, 57, 58, 53, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 30;
```
Explanation: The new source input1 creates a LocalTime object with the value "23:59:59". The corresponding follow-up input creates a JsonWriter and a LocalTime array with the same value. The byte array `body` represents the serialized JSON representation of the LocalTime array, where each time is represented as a string in the format "HH:mm:ss". The size of the byte array is 30, which corresponds to the length of the serialized JSON string.

## New input pair2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 30;
```
Explanation: The new source input2 creates a LocalTime object with the value "12:13:14". The corresponding follow-up input creates a JsonWriter and a LocalTime array with the same value. The byte array `body` represents the serialized JSON representation of the LocalTime array, where each time is represented as a string in the format "HH:mm:ss". The size of the byte array is 30, which corresponds to the length of the serialized JSON string.

## New input pair3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000001");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 46, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 49, 34, 44, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 31;
```
Explanation: The new source input3 creates a LocalTime object with the value "00:00:00.000000001". The corresponding follow-up input creates a JsonWriter and a LocalTime array with the same value. The byte array `body` represents the serialized JSON representation of the LocalTime array, where each time is represented as a string in the format "HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSS". The size of the byte array is 31, which corresponds to the length of the serialized JSON string.

## New input pair4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 51, 58, 53, 57, 58, 53, 57, 46, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 57, 34, 44, 34, 50, 51, 58, 53, 57, 58, 53, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 31;
```
Explanation: The new source input4 creates a LocalTime object with the value "23:59:59.999999999". The corresponding follow-up input creates a JsonWriter and a LocalTime array with the same value. The byte array `body` represents the serialized JSON representation of the LocalTime array, where each time is represented as a string in the format "HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSS".
