## New input pair0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that when the `element` is added to the set, it should be present in the set. Since `element` and `element2` have the same key and value, adding `element2` should not change the set.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that when the `element` is added to the set, it should be present in the set. Since `element` and `element2` have the same key and value, adding `element2` should not change the set.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that when the `element` is added to the set, it should be present in the set. Since `element` and `element2` have the same key and value, adding `element2` should not change the set.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("", 1, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("", 1, bias);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that when the `element` is added to the set, it should be present in the set. Since `element` and `element2` have the same key and value, adding `element2` should not change the set.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that when the `element` is added to the set, it should be present in the set. Since `element` and `element2` have the same key and value, adding `element2` should not change the set.
