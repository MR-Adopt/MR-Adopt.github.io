## New input pair1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same thread pool id as the original input pair. This ensures that the `getThreadPoolId()` method returns the expected thread pool id.

## New input pair2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same thread pool id as the original input pair. This ensures that the `getThreadPoolId()` method returns the expected thread pool id.

## New input pair3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same thread pool id as the original input pair. This ensures that the `getThreadPoolId()` method returns the expected thread pool id.
