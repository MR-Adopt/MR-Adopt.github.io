## New input pair0:
```java
    String input = "A";
    String encoded2 = "QQ==";
```
Explanation:
The original test case is testing the encoding and decoding of a string with a single character. The input string "A" is encoded to "QQ==" using Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding. The decoded string "QQ==" is then compared with the original input "A" using assertEquals.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String input = "AB";
    String encoded2 = "QUJD";
```
Explanation:
The original test case is testing the encoding and decoding of a string with two characters. The input string "AB" is encoded to "QUJD" using Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding. The decoded string "QUJD" is then compared with the original input "AB" using assertEquals.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String input = "ABC";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDRA==";
```
Explanation:
The original test case is testing the encoding and decoding of a string with three characters. The input string "ABC" is encoded to "QUJDRA==" using Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding. The decoded string "QUJDRA==" is then compared with the original input "ABC" using assertEquals.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String input = "ABCDE";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDREVG";
```
Explanation:
The original test case is testing the encoding and decoding of a string with five characters. The input string "ABCDE" is encoded to "QUJDREVG" using Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding. The decoded string "QUJDREVG" is then compared with the original input "ABCDE" using assertEquals.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String input = "ABCDEFG";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDREVGQw==";
```
Explanation:
The original test case is testing the encoding and decoding of a string with six characters. The input string "ABCDEFG" is encoded to "QUJDREVGQw==" using Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding. The decoded string "QUJDREVGQw==" is then compared with the original input "ABCDEFG" using assertEquals.
