## New input1:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = 0L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of possible values for a `Long` type, which is from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`. This value is the smallest possible `Long` value.

## New input2:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = 4L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of possible values for a `Long` type, which is from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`. This value is the largest possible `Long` value, which is less than the threshold.

## New input3:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = -1L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of possible values for a `Long` type, which is from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`. This value is the smallest possible `Long` value, which is greater than the threshold.

## New input4:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = -5L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of possible values for a `Long` type, which is from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`. This value is the smallest possible `Long` value, which is less than the threshold.

## New input5:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = 5L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the range of possible values for a `Long` type, which is from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`. This value is the threshold itself, which is not a valid input for the encryption method.
