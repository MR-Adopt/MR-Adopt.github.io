## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `getBlobServiceClient` method accepts an `Integer` as the first parameter, which can be `null` or any integer value. In this case, we are passing `0` as the `retryCount1`, which is a valid integer. The `ACCOUNT1` is also a valid string, as it is not null.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 10;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `getBlobServiceClient` method accepts an `Integer` as the first parameter, which can be `null` or any integer value. In this case, we are passing `10` as the `retryCount1`, which is a valid integer. The `ACCOUNT1` is also a valid string, as it is not null.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `getBlobServiceClient` method accepts an `Integer` as the first parameter, which can be `null` or any integer value. In this case, we are passing `-1` as the `retryCount1`, which is a valid integer. The `ACCOUNT1` is also a valid string, as it is not null.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `getBlobServiceClient` method accepts an `Integer` as the first parameter, which can be `null` or any integer value. In this case, we are passing `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as the `retryCount1`, which is a valid integer. The `ACCOUNT1` is also a valid string, as it is not null.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `getBlobServiceClient` method accepts an `Integer` as the first parameter, which can be `null` or any integer value. In this case, we are passing `null` as the `retryCount1`, which is a valid integer. The `ACCOUNT1` is also a valid string, as it is not null.
