## New input1:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid and boundary-case because it is the original XML string provided in the test case. It tests the method under test with a typical, non-empty XML string.

## New input2:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid and boundary-case because it is a simplified version of the original XML string. It removes one of the child elements, which should not affect the functionality of the method under test.

## New input3:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <Unknown language=\"Unknown\" scm=\"Unknown\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"Unknown\">https://unknown.com/</Location>\n" + "  </Unknown>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid and boundary-case because it includes an additional child element with unknown attributes and values. It tests the method under test with a more complex XML string, which should not affect the functionality of the method under test.

## New input4:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <Empty language=\"\" scm=\"\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"\" />\n" + "  </Empty>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid and boundary-case because it includes an additional child element with empty attributes and values. It tests the method under test with a more complex XML string, which should not affect the functionality of the method under test.

## New input5:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "  <Null language=\"null\" scm=\"null\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"null\" />\n" + "  </Null>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid and boundary-case because it includes an additional child element with null attributes and values. It tests the method under test with a more complex XML string, which should not affect the functionality of the method under test.
