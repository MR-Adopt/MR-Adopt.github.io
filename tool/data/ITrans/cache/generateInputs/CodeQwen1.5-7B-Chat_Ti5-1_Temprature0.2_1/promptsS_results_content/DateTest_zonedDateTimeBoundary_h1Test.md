## New input1:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.minusYears(1));
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses a ZonedDateTime object that is one year earlier than the original. This ensures that the serialization and deserialization process will handle edge cases related to time zones and date boundaries.

## New input2:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.plusYears(1));
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses a ZonedDateTime object that is one year later than the original. This ensures that the serialization and deserialization process will handle edge cases related to time zones and date boundaries.

## New input3:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.minusMonths(1));
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses a ZonedDateTime object that is one month earlier than the original. This ensures that the serialization and deserialization process will handle edge cases related to time zones and date boundaries.

## New input4:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.plusMonths(1));
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses a ZonedDateTime object that is one month later than the original. This ensures that the serialization and deserialization process will handle edge cases related to time zones and date boundaries.

## New input5:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now.minusDays(1));
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it uses a ZonedDateTime object that is one day earlier than the original. This ensures that the serialization and deserialization process will handle edge cases related to time zones and date boundaries.
