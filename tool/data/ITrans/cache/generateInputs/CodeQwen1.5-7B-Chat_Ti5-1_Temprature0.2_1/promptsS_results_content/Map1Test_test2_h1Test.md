## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least one entry.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123". The new value is 789L. This ensures that the map contains at least one entry with a non-default value.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least two entries.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" and adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "456" and the value is 789L. This ensures that the map contains at least two entries with non-default values.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
    v01.put("789", 789L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "789" and the value is 789L. This ensures that the map contains at least three entries.
