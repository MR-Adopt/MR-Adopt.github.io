## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("103", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes an additional key-value pair ("103", 3F), which is a valid scenario for the given test case. It ensures that the program under test can handle a map with more than two entries.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("", 0F);
```
Explanation: This input includes a key with an empty string as its key, which is a valid scenario for the given test case. It ensures that the program under test can handle a map with a non-string key.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("101", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input includes duplicate keys, which is a valid scenario for the given test case. It ensures that the program under test can handle a map with duplicate keys.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put(null, 0F);
```
Explanation: This input includes a null key, which is a valid scenario for the given test case. It ensures that the program under test can handle a map with a null key.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("101", null);
```
Explanation: This input includes a null value for a key, which is a valid scenario for the given test case. It ensures that the program under test can handle a map with a null value.
