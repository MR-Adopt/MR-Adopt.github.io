## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the range of valid I2C buses is from "0" to "7". The deviceBus is set to "0", which is a valid I2C bus.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the range of valid I2C buses is from "0" to "7". The deviceBus is set to "7", which is a valid I2C bus.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the range of valid I2C buses is from "0" to "7". The deviceBus is set to "8", which is not a valid I2C bus.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "-1";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the range of valid I2C buses is from "0" to "7". The deviceBus is set to "-1", which is not a valid I2C bus.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "abc";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the range of valid I2C buses is from "0" to "7". The deviceBus is set to "abc", which is not a valid I2C bus.
