## New input1:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
```
Explanation: This input consists of a sequence of single-digit ASCII characters (0-9). It is valid because it represents a simple sequence of bytes, which is a common use case for base64 encoding. This input also falls within the boundary of valid input as it contains a range of single-digit ASCII characters.

## New input2:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19};
```
Explanation: This input consists of a sequence of double-digit ASCII characters (10-19). It is valid because it represents a simple sequence of bytes, which is a common use case for base64 encoding. This input also falls within the boundary of valid input as it contains a range of double-digit ASCII characters.

## New input3:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = {20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29};
```
Explanation: This input consists of a sequence of triple-digit ASCII characters (20-29). It is valid because it represents a simple sequence of bytes, which is a common use case for base64 encoding. This input also falls within the boundary of valid input as it contains a range of triple-digit ASCII characters.

## New input4:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = {30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39};
```
Explanation: This input consists of a sequence of four-digit ASCII characters (30-39). It is valid because it represents a simple sequence of bytes, which is a common use case for base64 encoding. This input also falls within the boundary of valid input as it contains a range of four-digit ASCII characters.

## New input5:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = {40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49};
```
Explanation: This input consists of a sequence of five-digit ASCII characters (40-49). It is valid because it represents a simple sequence of bytes, which is a common use case for base64 encoding. This input also falls within the boundary of valid input as it contains a range of five-digit ASCII characters.
