## New input1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a `FieldDefinition` with an empty string as the name. The `name` field is of type `String`, which can be null or an empty string. An empty string is a valid value for the `name` field, and it does not violate the method's contract.

## New input2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a `FieldDefinition` with a null `TokenType`. The `type` field is of type `TokenType`, which can be null or an instance of the `TokenType` enum. A null value is a valid value for the `type` field, and it does not violate the method's contract.

## New input3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a `FieldDefinition` that is deprecated. The `deprecated` field is a boolean that indicates whether the `FieldDefinition` is deprecated. A deprecated `FieldDefinition` is a valid value for the `deprecated` field, and it does not violate the method's contract.

## New input4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description");
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a `FieldDefinition` with a description. The `description` field is a string that can be null or have a value. A description is a valid value for the `description` field, and it does not violate the method's contract.

## New input5:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setExample("example");
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a `FieldDefinition` with an example. The `example` field is a string that can be null or have a value. An example is a valid value for the `example` field, and it does not violate the method's contract.
