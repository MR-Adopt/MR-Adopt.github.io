## New input1:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("", false);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it tests the case where the key is an empty string and the value is false. This is a common and valid scenario in many applications.

## New input2:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("test1", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it tests the case where the value is null. This is a common and valid scenario in many applications.

## New input3:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("test1", true);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it tests the case where the key and value are both valid. This is a common and valid scenario in many applications.

## New input4:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("test1", false);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it tests the case where the value is false. This is a common and valid scenario in many applications.

## New input5:
```java
    Pair<String, Boolean> hutoolPair = new Pair<>("test1", true);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it tests the case where the key and value are both valid. This is a common and valid scenario in many applications.
