## New input1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the earliest possible time of the day, which is 00:00:00. It is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible value for a LocalTime object.

## New input2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the latest possible time of the day, which is 23:59:59. It is a boundary case because it is the largest possible value for a LocalTime object.

## New input3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("12:13:14");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a time that is not at the end of the day, which is 12:13:14. It is a boundary case because it is a valid time that is not at the end of the day.

## New input4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00.000000001");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the smallest possible time with nanoseconds, which is 00:00:00.000000001. It is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible value for a LocalTime object with nanoseconds.

## New input5:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the largest possible time with nanoseconds, which is 23:59:59.999999999. It is a boundary case because it is the largest possible value for a LocalTime object with nanoseconds.
