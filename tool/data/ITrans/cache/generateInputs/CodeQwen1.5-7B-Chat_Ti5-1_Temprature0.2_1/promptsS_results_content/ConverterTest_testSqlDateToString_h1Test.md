## New input1:
```java
    Class<?> clazz1 = LocalDate.class;
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Date date = new Date(now - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365); // 1 year ago
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a date that is exactly one year ago from the current time. This is a boundary case because it is not the most common or typical use case for converting a date to a string.

## New input2:
```java
    Class<?> clazz1 = LocalDate.class;
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Date date = new Date(now + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365); // 1 year from now
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a date that is exactly one year from the current time. This is a boundary case because it is not the most common or typical use case for converting a date to a string.

## New input3:
```java
    Class<?> clazz1 = LocalDate.class;
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Date date = new Date(now - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30); // 30 days ago
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a date that is exactly 30 days ago from the current time. This is a boundary case because it is not the most common or typical use case for converting a date to a string.

## New input4:
```java
    Class<?> clazz1 = LocalDate.class;
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Date date = new Date(now + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30); // 30 days from now
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a date that is exactly 30 days from the current time. This is a boundary case because it is not the most common or typical use case for converting a date to a string.

## New input5:
```java
    Class<?> clazz1 = LocalDate.class;
    long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Date date = new Date(now - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 100); // 100 years ago
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it creates a date that is exactly 100 years ago from the current time. This is a boundary case because it is not the most common or typical use case for converting a date to a string.
