## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the attribute name from "x" to "y". This change does not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only filters based on the attribute name and value.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the data type from `ColumnType.STRING` to `ColumnType.INTEGER`. This change does not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only filters based on the attribute name and value.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value from "hello" to "world". This change does not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only filters based on the attribute name and value.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "world");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a filter condition based on a secondary attribute. This change does not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only filters based on the attribute name and value.

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "null");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value from "hello" to "null". This change does not affect the functionality of the `IsFalseDimFilter` as it only filters based on the attribute name and value.
