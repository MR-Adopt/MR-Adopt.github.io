## New input1:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents a pair of zeros, which is a common and meaningful value in many scenarios.

## New input2:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents the maximum possible values for an integer pair, which is a typical scenario in many applications.

## New input3:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents the minimum possible values for an integer pair, which is a typical scenario in many applications.

## New input4:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(null, 2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents a pair where one of the values is null, which is a common and meaningful value in many scenarios.

## New input5:
```java
    Pair<Integer, Integer> pair = Pair.of(1, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary because it represents a pair where one of the values is null, which is a common and meaningful value in many scenarios.
