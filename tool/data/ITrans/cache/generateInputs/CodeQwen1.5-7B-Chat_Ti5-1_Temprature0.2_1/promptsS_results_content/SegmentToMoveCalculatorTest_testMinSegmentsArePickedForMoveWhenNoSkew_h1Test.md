## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` is designed to handle cases where the total number of segments is zero. It will return the minimum number of segments to move, which is defined as `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE`.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` is designed to handle cases where the total number of segments is one. It will return the minimum number of segments to move, which is defined as `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE`.

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` is designed to handle cases where the total number of segments is ten thousand. It will return the minimum number of segments to move, which is calculated based on the total number of segments and the upper bound of 100.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` is designed to handle cases where the total number of segments is one hundred thousand. It will return the minimum number of segments to move, which is calculated based on the total number of segments and the upper bound of 100.

## New input5:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the method `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` is designed to handle cases where the total number of segments is the maximum value that can be represented by an integer. It will return the minimum number of segments to move, which is defined as `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE`.
