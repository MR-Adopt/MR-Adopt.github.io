## New input1:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "192.168.1.1". This change should not affect the hashCode() method's output as the hashCode() method only considers the author, identity, comment, and ip fields for generating the hash code.

    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "10.0.0.1");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "10.0.0.1". This change should not affect the hashCode() method's output as the hashCode() method only considers the author, identity, comment, and ip fields for generating the hash code.

## New input3:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "172.16.0.1");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "172.16.0.1". This change should not affect the hashCode() method's output as the hashCode() method only considers the author, identity, comment, and ip fields for generating the hash code.

## New input4:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.0.1");

## New input5:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "8.8.8.8");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "8.8.8.8". This change should not affect the hashCode() method's output as the hashCode() method only considers the author, identity, comment, and ip fields for generating the hash code.
