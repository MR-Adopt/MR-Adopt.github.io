## New input1:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption and decryption methods handle the case where the input value is 0. The encryption process converts the value to a string, encrypts it using a cipher, and then encodes it to base64. The decryption process decodes the base64-encoded string, decrypts it using a cipher, and then converts it back to a long value. Therefore, the input 0 can be successfully encrypted and decrypted.

## New input2:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption and decryption methods handle the case where the input value is the maximum possible long value. The encryption process converts the value to a string, encrypts it using a cipher, and then encodes it to base64. The decryption process decodes the base64-encoded string, decrypts it using a cipher, and then converts it back to a long value. Therefore, the input Long.MAX_VALUE can be successfully encrypted and decrypted.

## New input3:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption and decryption methods handle the case where the input value is negative. The encryption process converts the value to a string, encrypts it using a cipher, and then encodes it to base64. The decryption process decodes the base64-encoded string, decrypts it using a cipher, and then converts it back to a long value. Therefore, the input -1 can be successfully encrypted and decrypted.

## New input4:
```java
    Long value = null;
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the encryption method throws an IllegalArgumentException if the input value is null. The decryption method also throws an IllegalArgumentException if the input value is null. Therefore, the input null cannot be successfully encrypted or decrypted.

## New input5:
```java
    Long value = 100_000L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the encryption and decryption methods handle the case where the input value is within the range of possible long values. The encryption process converts the value to a string, encrypts it using a cipher, and then encodes it to base64. The decryption process decodes the base64-encoded string, decrypts it using a cipher, and then converts it back to a long value. Therefore, the input 100_000 can be successfully encrypted and decrypted.
