## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "456" and the value is 456. This ensures that the map contains at least one entry.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from 123 to 456. This ensures that the map contains at least one entry with a non-zero value.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("456", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "456" and the value is 456. This ensures that the map contains at least two entries.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("456", 456);
    v01.put("789", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "789" and the value is 789. This ensures that the map contains at least three entries.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("456", 456);
    v01.put("789", 789);
    v01.put("101112", 101112);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map, where the key is "101112" and the value is 101112. This ensures that the map contains at least four entries.
