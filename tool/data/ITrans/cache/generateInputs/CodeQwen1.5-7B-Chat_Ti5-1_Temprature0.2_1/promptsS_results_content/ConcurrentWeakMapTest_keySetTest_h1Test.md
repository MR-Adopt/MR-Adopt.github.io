## New input1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(1, 1);
```
Explanation: This input includes a new key-value pair (1, 1) that is not present in the original map. This ensures that the `putAll` method is tested with a non-empty map that has a different key-value pair than the original map.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input includes a new key-value pair (0, 0) that is not present in the original map. This ensures that the `putAll` method is tested with a non-empty map that has a different key-value pair than the original map.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input includes a new key-value pair with the maximum possible integer value as the key and the maximum possible integer value as the value. This ensures that the `putAll` method is tested with a non-empty map that has a different key-value pair than the original map.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input includes a new key-value pair with the minimum possible integer value as the key and the minimum possible integer value as the value. This ensures that the `putAll` method is tested with a non-empty map that has a different key-value pair than the original map.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(null, 10);
```
Explanation: This input includes a new key-value pair with a null key and a non-null value. This ensures that the `putAll` method is tested with a non-empty map that has a different key-value pair than the original map.
