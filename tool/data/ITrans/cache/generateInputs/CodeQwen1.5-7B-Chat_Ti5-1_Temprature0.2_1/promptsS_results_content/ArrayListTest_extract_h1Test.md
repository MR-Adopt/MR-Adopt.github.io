## New input1:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `true`. This means that the `extractValues` method should trim the array to the size of the actual data before returning it. Since the `_data` array is initially empty, the returned array should also be empty. This input is valid because it tests the boundary case where the trim flag is set to true and the data array is empty.

## New input2:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(1);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `true` and the `_data` array contains a single element. The `extractValues` method should trim the array to the size of the actual data before returning it. Since the `_data` array contains one element, the returned array should also contain one element. This input is valid because it tests the boundary case where the trim flag is set to true and the data array contains one element.

## New input3:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(2);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `true` and the `_data` array contains two elements. The `extractValues` method should trim the array to the size of the actual data before returning it. Since the `_data` array contains two elements, the returned array should also contain two elements. This input is valid because it tests the boundary case where the trim flag is set to true and the data array contains two elements.

## New input4:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(2);
    boolean trimFlag = false;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `false` and the `_data` array contains two elements. The `extractValues` method should not trim the array to the size of the actual data before returning it. Since the `_data` array contains two elements, the returned array should also contain two elements. This input is valid because it tests the boundary case where the trim flag is set to false and the data array contains two elements.

## New input5:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    a.appendValue(1);
    a.appendValue(2);
    a.appendValue(3);
    boolean trimFlag = true;
```
Explanation: In this input, `trimFlag` is set to `true` and the `_data` array contains three elements. The `extractValues` method should trim the array to the size of the actual data before returning it. Since the `_data` array contains three elements, the returned array should also contain three elements. This input is valid because it tests the boundary case where the trim flag is set to true and the data array contains three elements.
