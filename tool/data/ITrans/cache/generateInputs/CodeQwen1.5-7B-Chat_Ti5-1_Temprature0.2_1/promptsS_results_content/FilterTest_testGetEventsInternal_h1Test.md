## New input1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it only adds one event to the filter. This is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible size of the filter.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent3);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds three events to the filter. This is a boundary case because it is the largest possible size of the filter.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an empty filter. This is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible size of the filter.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.remove(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it removes one event from the filter. This is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible size of the filter after removal.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.remove(mockEvent2);
    filter.remove(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it removes two events from the filter. This is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible size of the filter after removal.
