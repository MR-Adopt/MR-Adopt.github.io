## New input1:
```java
    String randomString = "0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the smallest possible long value, which is 0. It is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible value that can be represented as a long.

## New input2:
```java
    String randomString = "9223372036854775807";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the largest possible long value, which is 9223372036854775807. It is a boundary case because it is the largest possible value that can be represented as a long.

## New input3:
```java
    String randomString = "-1";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the smallest possible negative long value, which is -1. It is a boundary case because it is the smallest possible negative value that can be represented as a long.

## New input4:
```java
    String randomString = "1";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the largest possible positive long value, which is 1. It is a boundary case because it is the largest possible positive value that can be represented as a long.

## New input5:
```java
    String randomString = "1234567890123456789";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a valid long value. However, it is not a boundary case because it is not the smallest, largest, or any other special value that can be represented as a long.
