## New input1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(1, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new entry to the map, where the key is 1 and the value is 1. This is a boundary case because it is adding a new entry to the map, which is not an empty map.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new entry to the map, where the key is 0 and the value is 0. This is a boundary case because it is adding a new entry to the map, which is not an empty map.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new entry to the map, where the key is the maximum possible integer value and the value is the maximum possible integer value. This is a boundary case because it is adding a new entry to the map, which is not an empty map.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new entry to the map, where the key is the minimum possible integer value and the value is the minimum possible integer value. This is a boundary case because it is adding a new entry to the map, which is not an empty map.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(5, 10);
    anotherMap.put(4, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 7);
    anotherMap.put(null, 10);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new entry to the map, where the key is null and the value is 10. This is a boundary case because it is adding a new entry to the map, which is not an empty map.
