## New input1:
```java
    String NAME = "name1";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different value for `NAME` than the original test case. This ensures that the `contextA1` and `contextB1` are not equal, as they are generated with different names.

## New input2:
```java
    String NAME = "name2";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different value for `NAME` than the original test case. This ensures that the `contextA1` and `contextB1` are not equal, as they are generated with different names.

## New input3:
```java
    String NAME = "name3";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different value for `NAME` than the original test case. This ensures that the `contextA1` and `contextB1` are not equal, as they are generated with different names.

## New input4:
```java
    String NAME = "name4";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different value for `NAME` than the original test case. This ensures that the `contextA1` and `contextB1` are not equal, as they are generated with different names.

## New input5:
```java
    String NAME = "name5";
    SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it uses a different value for `NAME` than the original test case. This ensures that the `contextA1` and `contextB1` are not equal, as they are generated with different names.
