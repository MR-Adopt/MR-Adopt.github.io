## New input1:
```java
LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a date in a leap year (2020), which is a common year in the Gregorian calendar. This ensures that the method under test will correctly handle leap years.

## New input2:
```java
LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.of(2021, 1, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a date in a non-leap year (2021), which is a common year in the Gregorian calendar. This ensures that the method under test will correctly handle non-leap years.

## New input3:
```java
LocalDate date3 = LocalDate.of(1900, 1, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a date in a century year (1900), which is not a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar. This ensures that the method under test will correctly handle century years.

## New input4:
```java
LocalDate date4 = LocalDate.of(2000, 1, 1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents a date in a leap century year (2000), which is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar. This ensures that the method under test will correctly handle leap century years.

## New input5:
```java
LocalDate date5 = LocalDate.of(9999, 12, 31);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it represents the maximum possible date in the Gregorian calendar. This ensures that the method under test will correctly handle the maximum possible date.
