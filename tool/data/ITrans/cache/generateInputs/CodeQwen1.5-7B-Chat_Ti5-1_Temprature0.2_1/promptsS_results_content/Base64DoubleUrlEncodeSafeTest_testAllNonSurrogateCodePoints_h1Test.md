## New input1:
```java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    sb.append("A");
    String input = sb.toString();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it contains a single character, which is a valid ASCII character. The Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding of this string will result in a single character string, which is also a valid input for the decoding function.

## New input2:
```java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    sb.append("AB");
    String input = sb.toString();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it contains two characters, which are valid ASCII characters. The Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding of this string will result in a two-character string, which is also a valid input for the decoding function.

## New input3:
```java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    sb.append("ABC");
    String input = sb.toString();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it contains three characters, which are valid ASCII characters. The Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding of this string will result in a three-character string, which is also a valid input for the decoding function.

## New input4:
```java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    sb.append("ABCDE");
    String input = sb.toString();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it contains five characters, which are valid ASCII characters. The Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding of this string will result in a five-character string, which is also a valid input for the decoding function.

## New input5:
```java
    StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
    sb.append("ABCDEF");
    String input = sb.toString();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it contains six characters, which are valid ASCII characters. The Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding of this string will result in a six-character string, which is also a valid input for the decoding function.
