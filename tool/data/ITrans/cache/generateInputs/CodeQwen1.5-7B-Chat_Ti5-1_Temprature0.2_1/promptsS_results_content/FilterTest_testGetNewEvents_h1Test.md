```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");

    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with an empty type. This ensures that the filter can handle events with no type specified.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event3", "Type3", "");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with an empty description. This ensures that the filter can handle events with no description specified.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event4", "Type4", "Description4");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with a unique event name, type, and description. This ensures that the event is not a duplicate of the original event and that the filter can handle a variety of events.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event5", "Type5", "Description5");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
