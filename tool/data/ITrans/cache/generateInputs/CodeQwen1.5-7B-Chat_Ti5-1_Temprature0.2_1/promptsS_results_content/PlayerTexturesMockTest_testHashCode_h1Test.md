## New input1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setSkin` method allows null values, and the `hashCode` method should handle null gracefully.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", "value", "signature");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setProperty` method allows setting a `ProfileProperty` object, and the `hashCode` method should consider the `ProfileProperty` object in its calculation.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", "value", null);
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setProperty` method allows setting a `ProfileProperty` object with a null signature, and the `hashCode` method should consider the `ProfileProperty` object in its calculation.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty("textures", null, "signature");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setProperty` method allows setting a `ProfileProperty` object with a null value, and the `hashCode` method should consider the `ProfileProperty` object in its calculation.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    ProfileProperty property = new ProfileProperty(null, "value", "signature");
    playerTexturesMock.setProperty(property);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `setProperty` method allows setting a `ProfileProperty` object with a null name, and the `hashCode` method should consider the `ProfileProperty` object in its calculation.
