## New input1:
```java
    v01.put("123", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is "123" and the value is 456, which is different from the original value of 123.

## New input2:
```java
    v01.put("12x", 789);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it updates the value associated with the key "12x" to 789. The original value was 123, so this change maintains the integrity of the map.

## New input3:
```java
    v01.put("", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the map. The key is an empty string, which is a valid key in Java. The value is 123, which is the same as the original value.

## New input4:
```java
    v01.put("123", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it updates the value associated with the key "123" to null. This is a valid operation in Java, and it maintains the integrity of the map.

## New input5:
```java
    v01.put("12x", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it updates the value associated with the key "12x" to null. This is a valid operation in Java, and it maintains the integrity of the map.
