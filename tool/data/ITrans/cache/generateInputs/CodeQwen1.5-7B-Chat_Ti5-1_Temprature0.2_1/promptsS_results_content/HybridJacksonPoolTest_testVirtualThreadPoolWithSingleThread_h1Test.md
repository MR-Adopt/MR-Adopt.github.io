## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows a pool size of 0, which means there is no limit to the number of threads that can acquire pooled resources. This can be useful in scenarios where the pool size is not known in advance or when the pool size is dynamically adjusted.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows a pool size of 1, which means that only one thread can acquire pooled resources at a time. This can be useful in scenarios where the pool size is known to be small and the pool is used to manage resources that are not thread-safe.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows a pool size of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which means that the pool can support a large number of threads. This can be useful in scenarios where the pool size is known to be large and the pool is used to manage resources that are not thread-safe.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` does not allow a negative pool size. This can be useful in scenarios where the pool size is known to be small and the pool is used to manage resources that are not thread-safe.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows a pool size of 5, which means that five threads can acquire pooled resources at a time. This can be useful in scenarios where the pool size is known to be small and the pool is used to manage resources that are not thread-safe.
