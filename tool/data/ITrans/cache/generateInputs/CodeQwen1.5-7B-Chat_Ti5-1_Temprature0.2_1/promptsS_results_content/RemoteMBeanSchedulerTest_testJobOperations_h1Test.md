## New input1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, but with a different class (HelloJob instead of the original class). This ensures that the new job detail is different from the original job, and that the test case can verify that the scheduler correctly handles jobs with different classes.

## New input2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, but with a different storeDurably setting (true instead of the original false). This ensures that the new job detail is different from the original job, and that the test case can verify that the scheduler correctly handles jobs with different durability settings.

## New input3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, but with a different job key (job2 instead of the original job1). This ensures that the new job detail is different from the original job, and that the test case can verify that the scheduler correctly handles jobs with different keys.

## New input4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, but with a different group key (GROUP_KEY instead of the original GROUP_KEY). This ensures that the new job detail is different from the original job, and that the test case can verify that the scheduler correctly handles jobs with different group keys.

## New input5:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a new job detail with the same name and group as the original job, but with a different job key and group key (job2 and GROUP_KEY instead of the original job1 and GROUP_KEY). This ensures that the new job detail is different from the original job, and that the test case can verify that the scheduler correctly handles jobs with different keys and group keys.
