## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor1 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test1", manager, 10, 10, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread pool id ("test1") and different core and maximum pool size (10). This ensures that the thread pool id is different from the original executor.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor2 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test2", manager, 5, 10, 500L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different keep alive time (500ms) and different maximum pool size (10). This ensures that the keep alive time and maximum pool size are different from the original executor.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor3 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test3", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different work queue (LinkedBlockingQueue) instead of ArrayBlockingQueue. This ensures that the work queue is different from the original executor.

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor4 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test4", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), () -> new Thread(null, null, "testThread"), new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different thread factory (a custom thread factory that creates threads with a specific name). This ensures that the thread factory is different from the original executor.

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor5 = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test5", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a different rejection handler (CallerRunsPolicy). This ensures that the rejection handler is different from the original executor.
