## New input1:
```java
    String input = "A";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a single character string. The method under test will encode this string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, which will then be decoded back to the original string. This is a boundary case because the input string is very short.

## New input2:
```java
    String input = "AB";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a two-character string. The method under test will encode this string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, which will then be decoded back to the original string. This is a boundary case because the input string is slightly longer than the previous one.

## New input3:
```java
    String input = "ABC";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a three-character string. The method under test will encode this string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, which will then be decoded back to the original string. This is a boundary case because the input string is slightly longer than the previous one.

## New input4:
```java
    String input = "ABCDE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a five-character string. The method under test will encode this string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, which will then be decoded back to the original string. This is a boundary case because the input string is slightly longer than the previous one.

## New input5:
```java
    String input = "ABCDEFG";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a seven-character string. The method under test will encode this string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, which will then be decoded back to the original string. This is a boundary case because the input string is slightly longer than the previous one.
