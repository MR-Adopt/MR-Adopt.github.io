## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x7F";
```
Explanation: The device address "0x7F" is within the valid range of "0x70" to "0x77". This input is valid because it is a valid I2C address for an I2C multiplexer device.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
```
Explanation: The device address "0x00" is within the valid range of "0x70" to "0x77". This input is valid because it is a valid I2C address for an I2C multiplexer device.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0xFF";
```
Explanation: The device address "0xFF" is not within the valid range of "0x70" to "0x77". This input is invalid because it is not a valid I2C address for an I2C multiplexer device.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
```
Explanation: The device address "0x6F" is within the valid range of "0x70" to "0x77". This input is valid because it is a valid I2C address for an I2C multiplexer device.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
```
Explanation: The device address "0x78" is not within the valid range of "0x70" to "0x77". This input is invalid because it is not a valid I2C address for an I2C multiplexer device.
