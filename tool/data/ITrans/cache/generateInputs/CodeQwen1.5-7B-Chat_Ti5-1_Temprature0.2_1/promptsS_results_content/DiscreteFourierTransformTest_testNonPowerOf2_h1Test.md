## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(1, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the dimension of the input is 1, which is a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the smallest power of 2 is 1.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(2, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the dimension of the input is 2, which is a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the smallest power of 2 is 2.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(16, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(16);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the dimension of the input is 16, which is a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the largest power of 2 is 16.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(32, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(32);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the dimension of the input is 32, which is a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the largest power of 2 is 32.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(3, 1, Uniform.of(-2, 4));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(3);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the dimension of the input is 3, which is not a power of 2. This is a boundary case because the smallest non-power of 2 is 3.
