## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1.5);
    v01.put("102", 2.5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with double values. This is a common scenario when dealing with financial or scientific data.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 0.0);
    v01.put("102", 0.0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with zero values. Zero is a valid value for many applications, including financial calculations.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", -1.5);
    v01.put("102", -2.5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with negative double values. Negative values can be used in various scenarios, such as accounting or physics.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", Double.MAX_VALUE);
    v01.put("102", Double.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with the maximum and minimum double values. These are edge cases that should be handled correctly by the program under test.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Double> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", Double.NaN);
    v01.put("102", Double.NaN);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two entries with the Not-a-Number (NaN) value. NaN is a special value that should be handled correctly by the program under test.
