## New input pair1:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `parse` method of `XmlBuilder` class takes a string input `XML` and returns an instance of `XmlBuilder`. The `toXml` method of `XmlBuilder` class returns a string representation of the XML data stored in the `XmlBuilder` instance. The `assertEquals` method in the original test case compares the XML representation of `xmlBuilder2` with the original XML string `XML`. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we need to create a new `XmlBuilder` instance `xmlBuilder2` by calling the `parse` method with the same XML string `XML`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
    String XML2 = xmlBuilder2.toXml();
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `toXml` method of `XmlBuilder` class returns a string representation of the XML data stored in the `XmlBuilder` instance. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we need to create a new string `XML2` by calling the `toXml` method on the `xmlBuilder2` instance.
