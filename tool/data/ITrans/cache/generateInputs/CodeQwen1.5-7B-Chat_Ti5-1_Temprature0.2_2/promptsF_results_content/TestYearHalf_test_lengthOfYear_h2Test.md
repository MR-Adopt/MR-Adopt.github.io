## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2020, 2);
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1900, 1);
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 0;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(0, 2);
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    Half half = Half.H1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(9999, 1);
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 10000;
    Half half = Half.H2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(10000, 2);
```

## Explanation of inferred relation:
The inferred relation is that the length of the year is determined by the year and half-of-year. In the original test case, the length of the year is calculated using the `Year.isLeap(year)` method, which returns true if the year is a leap year and false otherwise. The length of the year is then compared to the expected length using the `assertEquals` method.

For each new source input pair, the follow-up input is generated by calling the `YearHalf.of` method with the corresponding year and half-of-year values. This ensures that the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation and passes the assertions in the original test case.
