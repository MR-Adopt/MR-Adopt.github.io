## New input pair0:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Integer.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Integer.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Integer> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Integer> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the source input `type1` and `type2` are equal, then the corresponding `Key` objects should also be equal. Since `Integer.class` is equal to itself, the `Key` objects `key1` and `key2` should also be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Double.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Double.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Double> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Double> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the source input `type1` and `type2` are equal, then the corresponding `Key` objects should also be equal. Since `Double.class` is equal to itself, the `Key` objects `key1` and `key2` should also be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Boolean.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Boolean.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Boolean> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Boolean> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the source input `type1` and `type2` are equal, then the corresponding `Key` objects should also be equal. Since `Boolean.class` is equal to itself, the `Key` objects `key1` and `key2` should also be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Void.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Void.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Void> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Void> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the source input `type1` and `type2` are equal, then the corresponding `Key` objects should also be equal. Since `Void.class` is equal to itself, the `Key` objects `key1` and `key2` should also be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Class<?> type1 = Object.class;
    Class<?> type2 = Object.class;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Key<Object> key1 = Key.get(type1);
    Key<Object> key2 = Key.get(type2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if the source input `type1` and `type2` are equal, then the corresponding `Key` objects should also be equal. Since `Object.class` is equal to itself, the `Key` objects `key1` and `key2` should also be equal.
