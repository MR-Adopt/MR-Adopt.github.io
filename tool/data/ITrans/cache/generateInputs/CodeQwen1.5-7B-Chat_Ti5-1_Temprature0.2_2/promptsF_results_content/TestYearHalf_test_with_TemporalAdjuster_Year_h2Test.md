## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2021;
    int year3 = 2021;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2021;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are different, the result should also be different. Therefore, we can infer that `year3` should be equal to `year2` and `half3` should be equal to `half1`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = year1;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the result should also be the same. Therefore, we can infer that `year3` should be equal to `year1` and `half3` should be equal to `half1`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2020;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = year1;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the result should also be the same. Therefore, we can infer that `year3` should be equal to `year1` and `half3` should be equal to `half1`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2021;
    int year3 = 2021;
    int half3 = 2;
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = year1 + 1;
    int year3 = year2;
    int half3 = half1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `year2` is different from `year1`, the result should also be different. Therefore, we can infer that `year3` should be equal to `year2` and `half3` should be equal to `half1`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int year3 = 2022;
    int half3 = 1;
```
### Code used to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = year1 + 2;
    int year3 = year2;
    int half3 = half1;
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation is that the result of `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).with(Year.of(year2))` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `year2` is different from `year1`, the result should also be different. Therefore, we can infer that `year3` should be equal to `year2` and `half3` should be equal to `half1`.
