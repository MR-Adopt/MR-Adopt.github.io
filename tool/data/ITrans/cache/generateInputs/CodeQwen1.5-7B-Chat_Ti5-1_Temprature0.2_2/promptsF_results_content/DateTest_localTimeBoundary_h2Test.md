## New input pair0:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 43;
```
Explanation: The new source input0 satisfies the inferred relation by using the same `LocalTime` instance `now` for both elements in the `LocalTime[] lts`. The `JsonWriter` and `byte[] body` are constructed using the same `LocalTime[] lts` and are expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.MIN;
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 43;
```
Explanation: The new source input1 satisfies the inferred relation by using the `LocalTime.MIN` instance `now` for both elements in the `LocalTime[] lts`. The `JsonWriter` and `byte[] body` are constructed using the same `LocalTime[] lts` and are expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.MAX;
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 43;
```
Explanation: The new source input2 satisfies the inferred relation by using the `LocalTime.MAX` instance `now` for both elements in the `LocalTime[] lts`. The `JsonWriter` and `byte[] body` are constructed using the same `LocalTime[] lts` and are expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.of(0, 0);
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 43;
```
Explanation: The new source input3 satisfies the inferred relation by using the `LocalTime.of(0, 0)` instance `now` for both elements in the `LocalTime[] lts`. The `JsonWriter` and `byte[] body` are constructed using the same `LocalTime[] lts` and are expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.of(23, 59, 59, 999999999);
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 44, 34, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 43;
```
Explanation: The new source input4 satisfies the inferred relation by using the `LocalTime.of(23, 59, 59, 999999999)` instance `now` for both elements in the `LocalTime[] lts`. The `JsonWriter` and `byte[] body` are constructed using the same `LocalTime[] lts` and are expected to pass the assertions in the original test case.
