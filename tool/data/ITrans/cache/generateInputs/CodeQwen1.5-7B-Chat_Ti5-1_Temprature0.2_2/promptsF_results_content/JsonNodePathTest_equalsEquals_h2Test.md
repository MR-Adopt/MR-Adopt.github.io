## New input pair0:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
    String token2 = "b";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token1 = "b";
    String token2 = "b";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
    assertEquals(a1, a2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both `token1` and `token2` should be equal to "b". This is because the `append` method of the `JsonNodePath` class is called with the same token, which should result in two paths that are equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String token1 = "c";
    String token2 = "c";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token1 = "c";
    String token2 = "c";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
    assertEquals(a1, a2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both `token1` and `token2` should be equal to "c". This is because the `append` method of the `JsonNodePath` class is called with the same token, which should result in two paths that are equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String token1 = "d";
    String token2 = "d";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token1 = "d";
    String token2 = "d";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
    assertEquals(a1, a2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both `token1` and `token2` should be equal to "d". This is because the `append` method of the `JsonNodePath` class is called with the same token, which should result in two paths that are equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String token1 = "e";
    String token2 = "e";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token1 = "e";
    String token2 = "e";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
    assertEquals(a1, a2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both `token1` and `token2` should be equal to "e". This is because the `append` method of the `JsonNodePath` class is called with the same token, which should result in two paths that are equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String token1 = "f";
    String token2 = "f";
```
### Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    String token1 = "f";
    String token2 = "f";
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append(token1);
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append(token2);
    assertEquals(a1, a2);
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that both `token1` and `token2` should be equal to "f". This is because the `append` method of the `JsonNodePath` class is called with the same token, which should result in two paths that are equal.
