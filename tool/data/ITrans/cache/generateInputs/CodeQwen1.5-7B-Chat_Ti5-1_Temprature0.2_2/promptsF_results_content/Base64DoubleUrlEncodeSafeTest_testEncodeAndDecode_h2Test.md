## New input pair0:
```java
    String input = "A";
    String encoded2 = "QQ==";
```
Explanation: The new source input `A` is encoded into `QQ==` using the `encode` method in the `METHOD UNDER TEST`. The `encode` method first encodes the input string into bytes using UTF-8 encoding, then encodes the bytes into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The `replace` method is used to replace the character to avoid with the replacement character. The resulting string is `QQ==`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String input = "AB";
    String encoded2 = "QUJD";
```
Explanation: The new source input `AB` is encoded into `QUJD` using the `encode` method in the `METHOD UNDER TEST`. The `encode` method first encodes the input string into bytes using UTF-8 encoding, then encodes the bytes into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The `replace` method is used to replace the character to avoid with the replacement character. The resulting string is `QUJD`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String input = "ABC";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDRA==";
```
Explanation: The new source input `ABC` is encoded into `QUJDRA==` using the `encode` method in the `METHOD UNDER TEST`. The `encode` method first encodes the input string into bytes using UTF-8 encoding, then encodes the bytes into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The `replace` method is used to replace the character to avoid with the replacement character. The resulting string is `QUJDRA==`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String input = "ABCD";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDRAU=";
```
Explanation: The new source input `ABCD` is encoded into `QUJDRAU=` using the `encode` method in the `METHOD UNDER TEST`. The `encode` method first encodes the input string into bytes using UTF-8 encoding, then encodes the bytes into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The `replace` method is used to replace the character to avoid with the replacement character. The resulting string is `QUJDRAU=`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String input = "ABCDE";
    String encoded2 = "QUJDRAUQ=";
```
Explanation: The new source input `ABCDE` is encoded into `QUJDRAUQ=` using the `encode` method in the `METHOD UNDER TEST`. The `encode` method first encodes the input string into bytes using UTF-8 encoding, then encodes the bytes into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string. The `replace` method is used to replace the character to avoid with the replacement character. The resulting string is `QUJDRAUQ=`.
