## New input pair0:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Explanation: The new source input `subject` is created with an empty string as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type. The `other3` is created with an empty string as the name and `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it is deprecated. The inferred relation is that the hash code of two `FieldDefinition` objects is equal if and only if their names and types are equal, and their deprecated status is the same. Since the names and types of `subject` and `other3` are the same, and their deprecated status is different, their hash codes are different.

## New input pair1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", null);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", null).deprecate();
```

Explanation: The new source input `subject` is created with the string "foo" as the name and `null` as the type. The `other3` is created with the string "foo" as the name and `null` as the type, and it is deprecated. The inferred relation is that the hash code of two `FieldDefinition` objects is equal if and only if their names and types are equal, and their deprecated status is the same. Since the names and types of `subject` and `other3` are the same, and their deprecated status is different, their hash codes are different.

## New input pair2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

Explanation: The new source input `subject` is created with the string "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it is deprecated. The `other3` is created with the string "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it is deprecated. The inferred relation is that the hash code of two `FieldDefinition` objects is equal if and only if their names and types are equal, and their deprecated status is the same. Since the names and types of `subject` and `other3` are the same, and their deprecated status is the same, their hash codes are equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDescription("This is a description").deprecate();
```

Explanation: The new source input `subject` is created with the string "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it has a description. The `other3` is created with the string "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it has a description, and it is deprecated. The inferred relation is that the hash code of two `FieldDefinition` objects is equal if and only if their names and types are equal, and their deprecated status is the same. Since the names and types of `subject` and `other3` are the same, and their deprecated status is the same, their hash codes are equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDefaultValue("default");
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).setDefaultValue("default").deprecate();
```

Explanation: The new source input `subject` is created with the string "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it has a default value. The `other3` is created with the string "foo" as the name, `TokenType.STRING` as the type, and it has a default value, and it is deprecated. The inferred relation is that the hash code of two `FieldDefinition` objects is equal if and only if their names and types are equal, and their deprecated status is the same. Since the names and types of `subject` and `other3` are the same, and their deprecated status is the same, their hash codes are equal.
