## New input pair0:
```java
    String tier = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier2";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier2, historicals2, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
    Assert.assertEquals(segmentsToMoveToFixSkew, segmentsToMove);
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the number of segments to move in the tier should be equal to the number of segments to move to fix skew. This is because the original test case is testing the scenario where the tier is already balanced, and the follow-up input is testing the scenario where the tier is not balanced but can still be balanced by moving segments.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String tier = "tier3";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    String tier2 = "tier3";

    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    int segmentsToMove = SegmentToMoveCalculator.computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier(tier2, historicals2, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
