## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
    set.add(element2);
```
Explanation: The new input pair `element2` is generated by adding the element to the `set` using the `add` method of the `LWWElementSet` class. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `set` and `otherSet` are different sets, as `element2` is added to `set` but not to `otherSet`.
