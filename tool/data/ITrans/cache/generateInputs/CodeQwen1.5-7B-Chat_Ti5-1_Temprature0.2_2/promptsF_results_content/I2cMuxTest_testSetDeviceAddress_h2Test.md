## New input pair0:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x07";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device address of `i2cMux` should update the device address of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, when we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0x07", we also need to set the device address of `i2cMux2` to "0x07" to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device address of `i2cMux` should update the device address of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, when we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0x78", we also need to set the device address of `i2cMux2` to "0x78" to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0xFF";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device address of `i2cMux` should update the device address of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, when we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0xFF", we also need to set the device address of `i2cMux2` to "0xFF" to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device address of `i2cMux` should update the device address of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, when we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0x00", we also need to set the device address of `i2cMux2` to "0x00" to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x70";
    I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
    assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress());
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that setting the device address of `i2cMux` should update the device address of `i2cMux2`. Therefore, when we set the device address of `i2cMux` to "0x70", we also need to set the device address of `i2cMux2` to "0x70" to satisfy the assertion in the original test case.
