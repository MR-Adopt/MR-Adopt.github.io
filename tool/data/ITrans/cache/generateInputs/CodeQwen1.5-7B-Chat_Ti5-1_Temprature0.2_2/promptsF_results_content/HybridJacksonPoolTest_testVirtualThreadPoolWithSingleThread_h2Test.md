## New input pair0:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should have the same behavior when the pool size is 0. Since the pool size is 0, the `acquirePooled()` method should always return a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance. Therefore, `virtualPool2` should also return a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when `acquirePooled()` is called.

## New input pair1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should have the same behavior when the pool size is 1. Since the pool size is 1, the `acquirePooled()` method should always return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance. Therefore, `virtualPool2` should also return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when `acquirePooled()` is called.

## New input pair2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should have the same behavior when the pool size is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Since the pool size is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the `acquirePooled()` method should always return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance. Therefore, `virtualPool2` should also return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when `acquirePooled()` is called.

## New input pair3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should have the same behavior when the pool size is -1. Since the pool size is -1, the `acquirePooled()` method should always return a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance. Therefore, `virtualPool2` should also return a new `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when `acquirePooled()` is called.

## New input pair4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(5);
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(5);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `virtualPool` and `virtualPool2` should have the same behavior when the pool size is 5. Since the pool size is 5, the `acquirePooled()` method should always return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance. Therefore, `virtualPool2` should also return the same `VThreadBufferRecycler` instance when `acquirePooled()` is called.
