## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = () -> {};
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and its `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`. Since `closeable` is a lambda expression that does not throw any exceptions, the `fromCloseable` method should create a `CloseableResourceHolder` instance and return it.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new IOException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and its `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`. Since `closeable` is an anonymous inner class that throws an `IOException`, the `fromCloseable` method should create a `CloseableResourceHolder` instance and return it.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            // No-op
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and its `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`. Since `closeable` is an anonymous inner class that does not throw any exceptions, the `fromCloseable` method should create a `CloseableResourceHolder` instance and return it.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new RuntimeException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Generation code:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Closeable() {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            throw new RuntimeException("Test exception");
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `holder2` should be an instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and its `get()` method should return the same `closeable` object as the input `closeable`. Since `closeable` is an anonymous inner class that throws a `RuntimeException`, the `fromCloseable` method should create a `CloseableResourceHolder` instance and return it.
