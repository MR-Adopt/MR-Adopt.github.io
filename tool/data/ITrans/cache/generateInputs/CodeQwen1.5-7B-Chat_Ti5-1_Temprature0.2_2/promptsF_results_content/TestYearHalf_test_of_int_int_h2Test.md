## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object is created using the `of` method with the same year and half values. Since the year is 0, the `YearHalf` object `test2` should also be created with the same year and half values.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object is created using the `of` method with the same year and half values. Since the year is 9999, the `YearHalf` object `test2` should also be created with the same year and half values.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = -1;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object is created using the `of` method with the same year and half values. Since the year is -1, the `YearHalf` object `test2` should also be created with the same year and half values.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 100;
    int half = 3;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object is created using the `of` method with the same year and half values. Since the half is 3, the `YearHalf` object `test2` should also be created with the same year and half values.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 100;
    int half = 0;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object is created using the `of` method with the same year and half values. Since the half is 0, the `YearHalf` object `test2` should also be created with the same year and half values.
