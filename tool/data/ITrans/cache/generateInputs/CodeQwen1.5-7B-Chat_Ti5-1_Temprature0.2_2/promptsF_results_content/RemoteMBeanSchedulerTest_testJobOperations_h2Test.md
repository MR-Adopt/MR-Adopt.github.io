## New input pair0:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `JobKey` and `JobDetail` are related. The `JobKey` is used to identify the job, and the `JobDetail` contains the details of the job. The `JobKey` and `JobDetail` are passed to the `addJob` method of the `remoteScheduler` to add the job to the scheduler. The `getJobDetail` method of the `remoteScheduler` is used to retrieve the `JobDetail` for a given `JobKey`. The `JobKey` and `JobDetail` are related because they are both used to identify and retrieve the job. Therefore, the `JobKey` and `JobDetail` are passed to the `addJob` method of the `remoteScheduler` to add the job to the scheduler, and then the `getJobDetail` method of the `remoteScheduler` is used to retrieve the `JobDetail` for the job.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", "")).storeDurably().build();
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", "");
```

## New input pair2:
```java

    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);

## New input pair3:
```java

    job2Detail.setDurability(false);
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);

## New input pair4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    job2Detail.setJobDataMap(new JobDataMap());
    JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
