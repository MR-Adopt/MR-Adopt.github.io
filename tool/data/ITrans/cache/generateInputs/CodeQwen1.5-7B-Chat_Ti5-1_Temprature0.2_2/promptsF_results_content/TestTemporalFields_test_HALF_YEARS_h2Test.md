## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the year and quarter of the first quarter should be the same as the year and quarter of the second quarter. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the year and quarter of the first quarter should be the same as the year and quarter of the second quarter. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the year and quarter of the first quarter should be the same as the year and quarter of the second quarter. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the year and quarter of the first quarter should be the same as the year and quarter of the second quarter. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 5;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 5;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the year and quarter of the first quarter should be the same as the year and quarter of the second quarter. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.
