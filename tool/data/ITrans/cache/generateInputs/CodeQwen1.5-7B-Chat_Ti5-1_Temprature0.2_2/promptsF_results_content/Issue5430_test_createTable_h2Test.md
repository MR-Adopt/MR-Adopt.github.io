## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
Generation code:
```java
    String newSql = normalizeSql(sql);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the normalized SQL should be the same regardless of the input. The normalization process involves removing unnecessary whitespace, replacing single quotes with double quotes, and removing duplicate spaces. Since the original SQL already meets the normalization criteria, the new SQL is the same as the original SQL.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\n" + "STORED AS TEXTFILE";

```

    String newSql = normalizeSql(sql);

## New input pair2:
```java

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS PARQUET";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS PARQUET";

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)\n" + "ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'\n" + "STORED AS AVRO";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS AVRO";
