## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new source input0 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two `FilterEvent` objects with the same event details. The `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are added to the `filter` and `filter2` respectively. The `getNewEvents()` method of `filter2` should return an array containing the JSON event object of `mockEvent`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new source input1 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two `FilterEvent` objects with empty event details. The `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are added to the `filter` and `filter2` respectively. The `getNewEvents()` method of `filter2` should return an array containing the JSON event object of `mockEvent`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "", "Description1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new source input2 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two `FilterEvent` objects with empty type details. The `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are added to the `filter` and `filter2` respectively. The `getNewEvents()` method of `filter2` should return an array containing the JSON event object of `mockEvent`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new source input3 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two `FilterEvent` objects with empty description details. The `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are added to the `filter` and `filter2` respectively. The `getNewEvents()` method of `filter2` should return an array containing the JSON event object of `mockEvent`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock(null, "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock(null, "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new source input4 satisfies the inferred relation by creating two `FilterEvent` objects with null event details. The `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are added to the `filter` and `filter2` respectively. The `getNewEvents()` method of `filter2` should return an array containing the JSON event object of `mockEvent`.
