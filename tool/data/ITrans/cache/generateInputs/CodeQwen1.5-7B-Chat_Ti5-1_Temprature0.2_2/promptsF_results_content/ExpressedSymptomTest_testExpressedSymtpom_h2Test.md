## New input pair0:
```java
    String name = "pain";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `module` variable is set to "testModule". For the new input pair0, the `module` variable is set to an empty string. Since the `addressSource` method does not perform any validation on the input, it is possible that the symptom object will be associated with an empty module. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the behavior of the `addressSource` method with an invalid input.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String name = "pain";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "testModule1234567890";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "testModule1234567890";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `module` variable is set to "testModule". For the new input pair1, the `module` variable is set to a string with a length of 10 characters. Since the `addressSource` method does not perform any validation on the input, it is possible that the symptom object will be associated with a module of this length. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the behavior of the `addressSource` method with a valid input.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String name = "pain";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "testModule_with_special_characters!";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "testModule_with_special_characters!";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `module` variable is set to "testModule". For the new input pair2, the `module` variable is set to a string with special characters. Since the `addressSource` method does not perform any validation on the input, it is possible that the symptom object will be associated with a module containing special characters. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the behavior of the `addressSource` method with a valid input.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String name = "pain";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = null;
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = null;
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `module` variable is set to "testModule". For the new input pair3, the `module` variable is set to null. Since the `addressSource` method does not perform any validation on the input, it is possible that the symptom object will be associated with a null module. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the behavior of the `addressSource` method with an invalid input.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String name = "pain";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "testModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "testModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```
Explanation:
In the original test case, the `module` variable is set to "testModule". For the new input pair4, the `module` variable is set to the same value twice. Since the `addressSource` method does not perform any validation on the input, it is possible that the symptom object will be associated with the same module twice. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the behavior of the `addressSource` method with a valid input.
