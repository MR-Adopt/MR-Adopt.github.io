## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be equal if they have the same value. Since subject and other both have a value of 0, their hashCodes should also be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be equal if they have the same value. Since subject and other both have a value of Integer.MAX_VALUE, their hashCodes should also be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be equal if they have the same value. Since subject and other both have a value of -1, their hashCodes should also be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be equal if they have the same value. Since subject and other both have a value of 1, their hashCodes should also be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the hashCode of two Cost objects should be equal if they have the same value. Since subject and other both have a value of 100, their hashCodes should also be equal.
