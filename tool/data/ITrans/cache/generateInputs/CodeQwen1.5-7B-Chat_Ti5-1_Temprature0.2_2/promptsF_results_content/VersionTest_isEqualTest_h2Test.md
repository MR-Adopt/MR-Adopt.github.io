## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0-A2";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are not equal if they are not the same. Since "1.0-A1" is not equal to "1.0-A2", the follow-up input is "1.0-A2".

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.1";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are not equal if they are not the same. Since "1.1.0" is not equal to "1.1.1", the follow-up input is "1.1.1".

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A2";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are not equal if they are not the same. Since "1.1.0-A1" is not equal to "1.1.0-A2", the follow-up input is "1.1.0-A2".

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are not equal if they are not the same. Since "1.0.0" is not equal to "1.0.1", the follow-up input is "1.0.1".

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-A2";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the version numbers are not equal if they are not the same. Since "1.0.0-A1" is not equal to "1.0.0-A2", the follow-up input is "1.0.0-A2".
