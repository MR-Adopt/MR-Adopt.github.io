## New input pair0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
Explanation: Since the source input `element` has the same key and value as the follow-up input `element2`, the inferred relation is that adding `element` to the set and then removing `element2` should result in the set not containing `element`. This is because the `remove` method checks if the element exists in the set before removing it, and since `element2` is a copy of `element` with the same key and value, it will be removed from the set.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: Since the source input `element` has the same key and value as the follow-up input `element2`, the inferred relation is that adding `element` to the set and then removing `element2` should result in the set not containing `element`. This is because the `remove` method checks if the element exists in the set before removing it, and since `element2` is a copy of `element` with the same key and value, it will be removed from the set.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", Integer.MIN_VALUE, bias);
```
Explanation: Since the source input `element` has the same key and value as the follow-up input `element2`, the inferred relation is that adding `element` to the set and then removing `element2` should result in the set not containing `element`. This is because the `remove` method checks if the element exists in the set before removing it, and since `element2` is a copy of `element` with the same key and value, it will be removed from the set.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", -1, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", -1, bias);
```
Explanation: Since the source input `element` has the same key and value as the follow-up input `element2`, the inferred relation is that adding `element` to the set and then removing `element2` should result in the set not containing `element`. This is because the `remove` method checks if the element exists in the set before removing it, and since `element2` is a copy of `element` with the same key and value, it will be removed from the set.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
    Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```
Explanation: Since the source input `element` has the same key and value as the follow-up input `element2`, the inferred relation is that adding `element` to the set and then removing `element2` should result in the set not containing `element`. This is because the `remove` method checks if the element exists in the set before removing it, and since `element2` is a copy of `element` with the same key and value, it will be removed from the set.
