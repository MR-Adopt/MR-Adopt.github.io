## New input pair0:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "255.255.255.255");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "255.255.255.255");
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "::1");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "::1");
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "");
    AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "");
```

## Explanation for each new input pair:
- New input pair0: The inferred relation is that the hash codes of two AuditInfo objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and ip. Since the source input `auditInfo1` has the same author, identity, comment, and ip as `auditInfo2`, their hash codes should also be equal.
- New input pair1: The inferred relation is that the hash codes of two AuditInfo objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and ip. Since the source input `auditInfo1` has the same author, identity, comment, and ip as `auditInfo2`, their hash codes should also be equal.
- New input pair2: The inferred relation is that the hash codes of two AuditInfo objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and ip. Since the source input `auditInfo1` has the same author, identity, comment, and ip as `auditInfo2`, their hash codes should also be equal.
- New input pair3: The inferred relation is that the hash codes of two AuditInfo objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and ip. Since the source input `auditInfo1` has the same author, identity, comment, and ip as `auditInfo2`, their hash codes should also be equal.
- New input pair4: The inferred relation is that the hash codes of two AuditInfo objects should be equal if they have the same author, identity, comment, and ip. Since the source input `auditInfo1` has the same author, identity, comment, and ip as `auditInfo2`, their hash codes should also be equal.
