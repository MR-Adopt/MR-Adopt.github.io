## New input pair0:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("");
    String type = "";
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same logic as the original test case. The `ActivityParams` object is created with an empty string as the activity type, and the `type` variable is set to the same empty string. This will result in the same activity parameters being retrieved from the `ScoringConfigGroup` object.

## New input pair1:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams(null);
    String type = null;
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same logic as the original test case. The `ActivityParams` object is created with a null activity type, and the `type` variable is set to the same null value. This will result in the same activity parameters being retrieved from the `ScoringConfigGroup` object.

## New input pair2:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type1");
    ap.setMode("car");
    String type = "type1";
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same logic as the original test case. The `ActivityParams` object is created with the activity type "type1", and the mode is set to "car". The `type` variable is set to the same activity type. This will result in the same activity parameters being retrieved from the `ScoringConfigGroup` object.

## New input pair3:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type1");
    ap.setMaximumDuration(Duration.ofHours(24));
    String type = "type1";
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same logic as the original test case. The `ActivityParams` object is created with the activity type "type1", and the maximum duration is set to 24 hours. The `type` variable is set to the same activity type. This will result in the same activity parameters being retrieved from the `ScoringConfigGroup` object.

## New input pair4:
```java
    ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type1");
    ap.setScoreExpression("1");
    String type = "type1";
```
The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it adheres to the same logic as the original test case. The `ActivityParams` object is created with the activity type "type1", and the score expression is set to "1". The `type` variable is set to the same activity type. This will result in the same activity parameters being retrieved from the `ScoringConfigGroup` object.
