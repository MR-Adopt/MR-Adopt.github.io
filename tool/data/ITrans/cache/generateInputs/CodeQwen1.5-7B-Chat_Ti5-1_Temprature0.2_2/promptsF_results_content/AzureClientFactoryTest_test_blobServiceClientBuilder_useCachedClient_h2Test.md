## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
The follow-up input for `retryCount1 = 3` and `ACCOUNT1 = "account"` is `retryCount2 = 3` and `ACCOUNT2 = "account"`, as they are the same as the original inputs. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `BlobServiceClient` instances are equal when the `retryCount` and `ACCOUNT` are the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
The follow-up input for `retryCount1 = 0` and `ACCOUNT1 = "account"` is `retryCount2 = 0` and `ACCOUNT2 = "account"`, as they are the same as the original inputs. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `BlobServiceClient` instances are equal when the `retryCount` and `ACCOUNT` are the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
The follow-up input for `retryCount1 = -1` and `ACCOUNT1 = "account"` is `retryCount2 = -1` and `ACCOUNT2 = "account"`, as they are the same as the original inputs. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `BlobServiceClient` instances are equal when the `retryCount` and `ACCOUNT` are the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount";
```
The follow-up input for `retryCount1 = null` and `ACCOUNT1 = "newAccount"` is `retryCount2 = null` and `ACCOUNT2 = "newAccount"`, as they are the same as the original inputs. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `BlobServiceClient` instances are equal when the `retryCount` and `ACCOUNT` are the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "";
```
The follow-up input for `retryCount1 = null` and `ACCOUNT1 = ""` is `retryCount2 = null` and `ACCOUNT2 = ""`, as they are the same as the original inputs. This satisfies the inferred relation that the `BlobServiceClient` instances are equal when the `retryCount` and `ACCOUNT` are the same.
