# New input pair0:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
## Code to generate follow-up input for input pair0:
```java
// No follow-up input is needed for this source input.
```
Explanation: The source input `executor` is the same as the original test case, so the follow-up input `support` is also the same as the original test case.

# New input pair1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
```
## Code to generate follow-up input for input pair1:
```java
// No follow-up input is needed for this source input.
```
Explanation: The source input `executor` is the same as the original test case, so the follow-up input `support` is also the same as the original test case.
