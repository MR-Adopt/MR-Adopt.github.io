## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new `Filter` object `filter2` and adds `mockEvent1` to it. This is consistent with the original test case where `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2` respectively. The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a new `ArrayList` of events, which is a copy of the original list, so `filter2.getEventsInternal()` returns a new list that is not the same as `events` in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

## New input pair2:

    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new `Filter` object `filter2` and adds `mockEvent1`, `mockEvent2`, and `mockEvent1` to it.

The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a new `ArrayList` of events, which is a copy of the original list, so `filter2.getEventsInternal()` returns a new list that is not the same as `events` in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();

## New input pair4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new `Filter` object `filter2` without adding any events to it. This is consistent with the original test case where `filter` and `filter2` are initialized with `mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2` respectively. The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a new `ArrayList` of events, which is a copy of the original list, so `filter2.getEventsInternal()` returns a new list that is not the same as `events` in the original test case.
