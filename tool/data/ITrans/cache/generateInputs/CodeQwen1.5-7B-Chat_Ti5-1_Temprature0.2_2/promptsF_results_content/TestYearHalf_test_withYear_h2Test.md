# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the `withYear` method should not change the year, and `half1` and `half3` should be the same as well. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2200;
    int year3 = 2200;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2200;
    int year3 = year2;
    int half3 = half1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the `withYear` method should not change the year, and `half1` and `half3` should be the same as well. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 1;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1900;
    int year3 = year2;
    int half3 = half1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the `withYear` method should not change the year, and `half1` and `half3` should be the same as well. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2300;
    int year3 = 2300;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year1 = 2200;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2300;
    int year3 = year2;
    int half3 = half1;
```

## Explanation:
The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` should be equal to `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)`. Since `year1` and `year2` are the same, the `withYear` method should not change the year, and `half1` and `half3` should be the same as well. Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
