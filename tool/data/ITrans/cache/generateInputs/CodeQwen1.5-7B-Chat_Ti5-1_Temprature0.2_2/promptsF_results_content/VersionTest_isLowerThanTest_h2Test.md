## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "0.9";
    String v2 = "0.9";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is checking if `a` is lower than `b`, and `a` and `b` are the same version, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-alpha";
    String v2 = "1.0-alpha";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is checking if `a` is lower than `b`, and `a` and `b` are the same version, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-beta";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-beta";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is checking if `a` is lower than `b`, and `a` and `b` are the same version, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-beta.1";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-beta.1";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is checking if `a` is lower than `b`, and `a` and `b` are the same version, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0.0-alpha.01";
    String v2 = "1.0.0-alpha.01";
```
Explanation: Since the original test case is checking if `a` is lower than `b`, and `a` and `b` are the same version, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
