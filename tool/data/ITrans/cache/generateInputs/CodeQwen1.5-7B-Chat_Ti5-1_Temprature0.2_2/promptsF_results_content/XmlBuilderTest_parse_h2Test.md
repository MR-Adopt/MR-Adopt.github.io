## New input pair1:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
    XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The new input pair1 satisfies the inferred relation because it is directly derived from the original source input `XML` by calling the `parse` method of the `XmlBuilder` class. The `parse` method takes a string input and returns an instance of `XmlBuilder` which is then assigned to `xmlBuilder2`. This new input pair ensures that the `xmlBuilder2` object is created from the same XML string as the original `XML` input, and thus satisfies the assertion in the original test case.
