## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half with "-H". Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H2";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half with "-H". Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H1";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half with "-H". Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H2";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1900-H2";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half with "-H". Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2000-H1";
```
## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2000-H1";
```
Explanation: The inferred relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the text is generated by concatenating the year and half with "-H". Therefore, the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation.
