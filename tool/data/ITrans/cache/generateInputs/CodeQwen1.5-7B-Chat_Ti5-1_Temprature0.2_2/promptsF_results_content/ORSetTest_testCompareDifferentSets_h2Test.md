## New input pair1:
```java
    String element2 = "C";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String element2 = "C";
    orSet2.add(element2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `compare` method returns `false` when the two sets are not equal. Since we are adding a new element to `orSet2` and comparing it with `orSet1`, the two sets will not be equal, hence the `compare` method should return `false`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String element2 = "D";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String element2 = "D";
    orSet2.add(element2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `compare` method returns `false` when the two sets are not equal. Since we are adding a new element to `orSet2` and comparing it with `orSet1`, the two sets will not be equal, hence the `compare` method should return `false`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String element2 = "E";
```
Generation of follow-up input:
```java
    String element2 = "E";
    orSet2.add(element2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `compare` method returns `false` when the two sets are not equal. Since we are adding a new element to `orSet2` and comparing it with `orSet1`, the two sets will not be equal, hence the `compare` method should return `false`.
