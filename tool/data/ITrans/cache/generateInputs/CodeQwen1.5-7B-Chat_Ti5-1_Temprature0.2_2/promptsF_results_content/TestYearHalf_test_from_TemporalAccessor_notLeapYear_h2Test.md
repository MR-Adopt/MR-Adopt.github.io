## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1);
int year = 2020;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year and expected value are derived from the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 1, so the expected value is 1.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2021;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2021, 12, 31);
int year = 2021;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year and expected value are derived from the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 12, so the expected value is 2.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 1900;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(1900, 2, 28);
int year = 1900;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year and expected value are derived from the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 2, so the expected value is 1.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2000, 2, 29);
int year = 2000;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year and expected value are derived from the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 2, so the expected value is 1.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Generation code:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 6, 15);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the year and expected value are derived from the month value of the date. For the new source input, the month value is 6, so the expected value is 2.
