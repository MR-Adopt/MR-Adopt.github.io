## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text string should follow the format "year-hhalf". Since the year is 2020 and the half is 2, the corresponding text string is "2020-h2".

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1999-h1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text string should follow the format "year-hhalf". Since the year is 1999 and the half is 1, the corresponding text string is "1999-h1".

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h2";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text string should follow the format "year-hhalf". Since the year is 2000 and the half is 2, the corresponding text string is "2000-h2".

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2100;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2100-h1";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text string should follow the format "year-hhalf". Since the year is 2100 and the half is 1, the corresponding text string is "2100-h1".

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1800;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1800-h2";
```
### Explanation:
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the text string should follow the format "year-hhalf". Since the year is 1800 and the half is 2, the corresponding text string is "1800-h2".
