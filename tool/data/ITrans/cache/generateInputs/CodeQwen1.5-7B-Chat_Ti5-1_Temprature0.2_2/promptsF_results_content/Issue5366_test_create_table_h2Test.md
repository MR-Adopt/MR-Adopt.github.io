## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders\n" + "    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
The inferred relation between the source input and the follow-up input is that the SQL statements are identical, except for the whitespace and comma removal. The new input pair satisfies this relation because it removes the extra whitespace and commas from the original SQL statement. The code used to generate the follow-up input is as follows:
```java
String newSql = normalizeSql(sql);
```
This code calls the `normalizeSql` method with the original SQL statement as the input, which removes all unnecessary whitespace and commas. The resulting normalized SQL statement is then assigned to the `newSql` variable.
