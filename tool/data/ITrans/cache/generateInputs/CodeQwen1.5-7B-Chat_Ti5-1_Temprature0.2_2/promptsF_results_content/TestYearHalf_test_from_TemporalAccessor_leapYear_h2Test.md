## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    int year = 2009;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the `year` and `date`. Since the `year` is different, the `expected` value will also be different.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2010;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    int year = 2010;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the `year` and `date`. Since the `year` is different, the `expected` value will also be different.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2011;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
    int year = 2011;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the `year` and `date`. Since the `year` is different, the `expected` value will also be different.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2012;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input4:
```java
    int year = 2012;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the `year` and `date`. Since the `year` is different, the `expected` value will also be different.

## New input pair5:
```java
    int year = 2013;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
### Code to generate follow-up input5:
```java
    int year = 2013;
    int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `expected` value is calculated based on the `year` and `date`. Since the `year` is different, the `expected` value will also be different.
