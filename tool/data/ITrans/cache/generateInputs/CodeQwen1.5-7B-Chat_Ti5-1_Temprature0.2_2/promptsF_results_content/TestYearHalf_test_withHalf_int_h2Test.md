# New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2020;
    int half3 = 2;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input0:
```java
    int year1 = 2020;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1 + half2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should return the same `YearHalf` as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half1 + half2` equals 3, which is not a valid half-of-year, the method should throw an exception. However, since the original test case does not assert that an exception is thrown, we can infer that the method should return the same `YearHalf` as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

# New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 1900;
    int half3 = 1;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input1:
```java
    int year1 = 1900;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1 - half2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should return the same `YearHalf` as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half1 - half2` equals 1, which is a valid half-of-year, the method should return the same `YearHalf` as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

# New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2100;
    int half3 = 3;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input2:
```java
    int year1 = 2100;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1 + half2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should return the same `YearHalf` as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half1 + half2` equals 3, which is a valid half-of-year, the method should return the same `YearHalf` as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

# New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 1800;
    int half3 = 3;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input3:
```java
    int year1 = 1800;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1 + half2;
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withHalf(half2)` should return the same `YearHalf` as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. Since `half1 + half2` equals 3, which is a valid half-of-year, the method should return the same `YearHalf` as `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

# New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 3;
```
## Code to generate follow-up input4:

    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = year1;
    int half3 = half1 + half2;
