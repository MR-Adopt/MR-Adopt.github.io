## New input1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a cost of 0 seconds, which is a valid scenario for the `Cost` class. This input tests the edge case where the cost is zero.

## New input2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a cost of the maximum value an integer can hold, which is a valid scenario for the `Cost` class. This input tests the edge case where the cost is at its maximum value.

## New input3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a cost of negative one second, which is a valid scenario for the `Cost` class. This input tests the edge case where the cost is negative.

## New input4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a cost of one second, which is a valid scenario for the `Cost` class. This input tests the typical case where the cost is positive.

## New input5:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(100);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `costOfSeconds` method allows for the creation of a cost of 100 seconds, which is a valid scenario for the `Cost` class. This input tests the typical case where the cost is greater than zero.
