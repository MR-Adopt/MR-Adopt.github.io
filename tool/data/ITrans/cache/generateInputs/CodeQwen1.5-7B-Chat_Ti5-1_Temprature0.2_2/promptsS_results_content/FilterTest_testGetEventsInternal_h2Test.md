## New input1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```

## New input2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds only one event to the filter. This is a boundary case because it tests the function with a smaller set of data.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two occurrences of the same event to the filter. This is a boundary case because it tests the function with a larger set of data.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds two occurrences of each event to the filter. This is a boundary case because it tests the function with a larger set of data.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates an empty filter. This is a boundary case because it tests the function with an empty set of data.
