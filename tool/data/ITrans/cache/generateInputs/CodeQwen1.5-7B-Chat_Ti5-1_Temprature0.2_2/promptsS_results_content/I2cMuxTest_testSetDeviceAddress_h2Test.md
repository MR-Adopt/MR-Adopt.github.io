## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x07";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the valid range of I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". The address "0x07" is a valid address, but it is not the default address of the i2cMux device.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x78";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the valid range of I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". The address "0x78" is not a valid address for the i2cMux device, but it is a valid I2C address.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0xFF";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the valid range of I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". The address "0xFF" is not a valid address for the i2cMux device, but it is a valid I2C address.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x00";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the valid range of I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". The address "0x00" is not a valid address for the i2cMux device, but it is a valid I2C address.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x70";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it falls within the valid range of I2C addresses, which is from "0x70" to "0x77". The address "0x70" is the default address of the i2cMux device.
