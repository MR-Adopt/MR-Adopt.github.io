## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows the number of stripes to be 0. In this case, the pool will not use any striping, and each thread will have its own pooled resource. This is a boundary-case scenario because it tests the edge case where the number of stripes is 0.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows the number of stripes to be 1. In this case, the pool will use a single stripe, and all threads will share the same pooled resource. This is a boundary-case scenario because it tests the edge case where the number of stripes is 1.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows the number of stripes to be `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. In this case, the pool will use the maximum possible number of stripes, which is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This is a boundary-case scenario because it tests the edge case where the number of stripes is the maximum possible value.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` does not allow the number of stripes to be negative. In this case, the constructor will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`. This is a boundary-case scenario because it tests the edge case where the number of stripes is negative.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the constructor of `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` allows the number of stripes to be any positive integer. In this case, the pool will use 5 stripes, and each thread will have its own pooled resource. This is a typical scenario because it tests the typical use case where the number of stripes is a positive integer.
