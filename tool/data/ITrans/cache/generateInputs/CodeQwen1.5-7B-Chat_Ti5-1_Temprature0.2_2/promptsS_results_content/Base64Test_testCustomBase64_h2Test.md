## New input1:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
```
Explanation: This input consists of 10 bytes, each ranging from 0 to 9. This is a valid input because it meets the requirements of the Base64 encoding algorithm, which requires that the input data be a multiple of 3 bytes.

## New input2:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
```
Explanation: This input consists of 11 bytes, each ranging from 0 to 9. This is a valid input because it meets the requirements of the Base64 encoding algorithm, which requires that the input data be a multiple of 3 bytes.

## New input3:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11};
```
Explanation: This input consists of 12 bytes, each ranging from 0 to 9. This is a valid input because it meets the requirements of the Base64 encoding algorithm, which requires that the input data be a multiple of 3 bytes.

## New input4:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12};
```
Explanation: This input consists of 13 bytes, each ranging from 0 to 9. This is a valid input because it meets the requirements of the Base64 encoding algorithm, which requires that the input data be a multiple of 3 bytes.

## New input5:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13};
```
Explanation: This input consists of 14 bytes, each ranging from 0 to 9. This is a valid input because it meets the requirements of the Base64 encoding algorithm, which requires that the input data be a multiple of 3 bytes.
