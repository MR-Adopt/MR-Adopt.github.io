## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the range of possible device buses for the I2cMux is "0" - "7". The value "0" is a valid and boundary-case value for the device bus.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the range of possible device buses for the I2cMux is "0" - "7". The value "7" is a valid and boundary-case value for the device bus.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "8";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the range of possible device buses for the I2cMux is "0" - "7". The value "8" is not a valid value for the device bus.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the device bus cannot be an empty string. The device bus must be a valid string representing a number between "0" and "7".

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "abc";
```
Explanation: This input is invalid because the device bus cannot be a non-numeric string. The device bus must be a valid string representing a number between "0" and "7".
