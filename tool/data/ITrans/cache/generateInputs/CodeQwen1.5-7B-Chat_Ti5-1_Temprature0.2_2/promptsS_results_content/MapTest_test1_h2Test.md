## New input1:
```java
    v01.put("123", 123);
    v01.put("12x", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it maintains the same structure as the original test case. It includes a key-value pair where the key is a string representation of a number and the value is the same number. This is a common and valid scenario when dealing with JSON data.

## New input2:
```java
    v01.put("empty", "");
    v01.put("null", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a key-value pair where the key is a string representation of an empty string and the value is null. This is a common and valid scenario when dealing with JSON data.

## New input3:
```java
    v01.put("negative", -123);
    v01.put("positive", 123);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a key-value pair where the key is a string representation of a negative and positive number and the value is the same number. This is a common and valid scenario when dealing with JSON data.

## New input4:
```java
    v01.put("boolean", true);
    v01.put("boolean", false);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a key-value pair where the key is a string representation of a boolean and the value is the same boolean. This is a common and valid scenario when dealing with JSON data.

## New input5:
```java
    v01.put("array", new int[]{1, 2, 3});
    v01.put("object", new HashMap<String, Integer>() {{
        put("1", 1);
        put("2", 2);
    }});
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it includes a key-value pair where the key is a string representation of an array and the value is an array of integers. It also includes a key-value pair where the key is a string representation of an object and the value is a HashMap of strings to integers. This is a common and valid scenario when dealing with JSON data.
