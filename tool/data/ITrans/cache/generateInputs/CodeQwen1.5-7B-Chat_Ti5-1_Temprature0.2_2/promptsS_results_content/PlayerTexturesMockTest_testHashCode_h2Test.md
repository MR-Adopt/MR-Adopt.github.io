## New input1:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin1"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets a different skin URL from the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the skin URL to null, which is a valid value for the `setSkin` method.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets a different skin and cape URL.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(new URL("https://github.com/skin"));
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets a different skin URL and nullifies the cape URL.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayerTexturesMock playerTexturesMock = new PlayerTexturesMock(profile);
    playerTexturesMock.setSkin(null);
    playerTexturesMock.setCape(new URL("https://github.com/cape"));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets a null skin URL and a different cape URL.
