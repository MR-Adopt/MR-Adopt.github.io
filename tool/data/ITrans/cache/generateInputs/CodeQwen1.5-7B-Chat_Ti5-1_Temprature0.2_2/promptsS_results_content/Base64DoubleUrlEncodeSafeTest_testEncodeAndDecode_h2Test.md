## New input1:
```java
    String input = "A";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a single character string, which is a boundary case in the context of encoding and decoding. The encoding process will convert this single character into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, and the decoding process will convert it back to the original single character string.

## New input2:
```java
    String input = "AB";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a two-character string, which is a boundary case in the context of encoding and decoding. The encoding process will convert this two-character string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, and the decoding process will convert it back to the original two-character string.

## New input3:
```java
    String input = "ABC";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a three-character string, which is a boundary case in the context of encoding and decoding. The encoding process will convert this three-character string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, and the decoding process will convert it back to the original three-character string.

## New input4:
```java
    String input = "ABCD";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a four-character string, which is a boundary case in the context of encoding and decoding. The encoding process will convert this four-character string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, and the decoding process will convert it back to the original four-character string.

## New input5:
```java
    String input = "ABCDE";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a five-character string, which is a boundary case in the context of encoding and decoding. The encoding process will convert this five-character string into a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe string, and the decoding process will convert it back to the original five-character string.
