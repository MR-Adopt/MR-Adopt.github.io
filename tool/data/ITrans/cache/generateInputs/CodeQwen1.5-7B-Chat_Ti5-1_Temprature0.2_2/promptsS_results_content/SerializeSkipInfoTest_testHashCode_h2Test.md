## New input1:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the field name to an empty string, which is a valid input for the `setFieldName` method. This will result in a hash code that is the same as the hash code of the original `serializeSkipInfo` object, as the `hashCode` method is based on both the `fullClassName` and `fieldName` fields.

## New input2:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the full class name to an empty string, which is a valid input for the `setFullClassName` method. This will result in a hash code that is the same as the hash code of the original `serializeSkipInfo` object, as the `hashCode` method is based on both the `fullClassName` and `fieldName` fields.

## New input3:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the field name and full class name to the same values as the original `serializeSkipInfo` object, which is a valid input for the `setFieldName` and `setFullClassName` methods. This will result in a hash code that is the same as the hash code of the original `serializeSkipInfo` object, as the `hashCode` method is based on both the `fullClassName` and `fieldName` fields.

## New input4:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the field name and full class name to the same values as the original `serializeSkipInfo` object, which is a valid input for the `setFieldName` and `setFullClassName` methods. This will result in a hash code that is the same as the hash code of the original `serializeSkipInfo` object, as the `hashCode` method is based on both the `fullClassName` and `fieldName` fields.

## New input5:
```java
    SerializeSkipInfo serializeSkipInfo = new SerializeSkipInfo();
    serializeSkipInfo.setFieldName("testFieldName1,testFieldName2");
    serializeSkipInfo.setFullClassName("testFullClassName");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it sets the field name and full class name to the same values as the original `serializeSkipInfo` object, which is a valid input for the `setFieldName` and `setFullClassName` methods. This will result in a hash code that is the same as the hash code of the original `serializeSkipInfo` object, as the `hashCode` method is based on both the `fullClassName` and `fieldName` fields.
