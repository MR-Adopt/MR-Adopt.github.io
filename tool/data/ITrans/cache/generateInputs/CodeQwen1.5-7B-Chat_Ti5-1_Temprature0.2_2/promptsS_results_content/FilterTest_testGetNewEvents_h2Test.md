## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with non-null values for `name`, `type`, and `description`. It tests the method with a typical event.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("", "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with an empty `name`. It tests the method with an event where the `name` is an empty string.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with an empty `type`. It tests the method with an event where the `type` is an empty string.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock("Event1", "Type1", "");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with an empty `description`. It tests the method with an event where the `description` is an empty string.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock(null, "Type1", "Description1");
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `FilterEvent` with a `null` `name`. It tests the method with an event where the `name` is `null`.
