## New input1:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "192.168.1.1");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "192.168.1.1". This change in IP address should not affect the hashCode() method, as the hashCode() method is based on the author, identity, comment, and ip fields, and only the IP address field is being changed.

## New input2:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "0.0.0.0");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "0.0.0.0". This change in IP address should not affect the hashCode() method, as the hashCode() method is based on the author, identity, comment, and ip fields, and only the IP address field is being changed.

## New input3:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "255.255.255.255");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "255.255.255.255". This change in IP address should not affect the hashCode() method, as the hashCode() method is based on the author, identity, comment, and ip fields, and only the IP address field is being changed.

## New input4:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "::1");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to "::1". This change in IP address should not affect the hashCode() method, as the hashCode() method is based on the author, identity, comment, and ip fields, and only the IP address field is being changed.

## New input5:
```java
    AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", "");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the IP address from "127.0.0.1" to an empty string. This change in IP address should not affect the hashCode() method, as the hashCode() method is based on the author, identity, comment, and ip fields, and only the IP address field is being changed.
