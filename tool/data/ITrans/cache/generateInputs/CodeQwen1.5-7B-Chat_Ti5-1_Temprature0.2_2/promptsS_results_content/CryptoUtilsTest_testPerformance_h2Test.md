## New input1:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a boundary case. The encryption and decryption processes should handle zero values correctly.

## New input2:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a boundary case. The encryption and decryption processes should handle the maximum possible long value correctly.

## New input3:
```java
    Long value = Long.MIN_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a boundary case. The encryption and decryption processes should handle the minimum possible long value correctly.

## New input4:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a boundary case. The encryption and decryption processes should handle negative values correctly.

## New input5:
```java
    Long value = 100L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it is a typical case. The encryption and decryption processes should handle a typical long value correctly.
