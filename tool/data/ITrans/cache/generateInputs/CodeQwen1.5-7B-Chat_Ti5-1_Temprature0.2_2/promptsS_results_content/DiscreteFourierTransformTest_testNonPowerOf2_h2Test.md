## New input1:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(5, 1, Uniform.of(-10, 10));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(5);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 5x1 matrix with random double values between -10 and 10. The dimension is a prime number, which is a boundary case for the Discrete Fourier Transform.

## New input2:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(8, 1, Uniform.of(-100, 100));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(8);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 8x1 matrix with random double values between -100 and 100. The dimension is a power of 2, which is a common case for the Discrete Fourier Transform.

## New input3:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(11, 1, Uniform.of(-1, 1));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(11);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 11x1 matrix with random double values between -1 and 1. The dimension is a prime number, which is a boundary case for the Discrete Fourier Transform.

## New input4:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(1, 1, Uniform.of(-5, 5));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 1x1 matrix with random double values between -5 and 5. The dimension is a power of 2, which is a common case for the Discrete Fourier Transform.

## New input5:
```java
        PhysicalStore<Double> input = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.makeFilled(15, 1, Uniform.of(-50, 50));
        DiscreteFourierTransform transformer = DiscreteFourierTransform.newInstance(15);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a 15x1 matrix with random double values between -50 and 50. The dimension is a prime number, which is a boundary case for the Discrete Fourier Transform.
