## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(0));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(0));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are 0. This is a common scenario where the values in a map are all zeros.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MAX_VALUE));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are the maximum and minimum values that can be stored in a `BigInteger`. This is a scenario where the values in the map are at their maximum and minimum limits.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MAX_VALUE));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MAX_VALUE));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are the maximum value that can be stored in a `BigInteger`. This is a scenario where the values in the map are at their maximum limit.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains two key-value pairs, where both keys are "101" and "102", and both values are the minimum value that can be stored in a `BigInteger`. This is a scenario where the values in the map are at their minimum limit.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, BigInteger> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MAX_VALUE));
    v01.put("102", BigInteger.valueOf(Long.MIN_VALUE));
    v01.put("103", BigInteger.valueOf(0));
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it contains three key-value pairs, where two keys are "101" and "102", and one key is "103". The values for "101" and "102" are the maximum and minimum values that can be stored in a `BigInteger`, and the value for "103" is 0. This is a scenario where the values in the map are at their maximum and minimum limits, and there is a zero value in the map.
