## New input1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a job with the same name and group as the original job, but it uses a different job class (`HelloJob.class`). This ensures that the job is not a duplicate of the original job, and it demonstrates the flexibility of the `addJob` method to handle different job classes.

## New input2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", "")).storeDurably().build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a job with an empty group name. This demonstrates the flexibility of the `addJob` method to handle different group names, and it ensures that the job is not placed in the default group.

## New input3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably(false).build();
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a job that is not durable. This demonstrates the flexibility of the `addJob` method to handle different job durability settings, and it ensures that the job is not stored in the database.

## New input4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    job2Detail.setDurability(false);
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a job that is not durable and then sets the durability to false. This demonstrates the flexibility of the `addJob` method to handle different job durability settings, and it ensures that the job is not stored in the database.

## New input5:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
    job2Detail.setJobDataMap(new JobDataMap());
```
Explanation: This input is valid and boundary-case because it creates a job with an empty job data map. This demonstrates the flexibility of the `addJob` method to handle different job data map settings, and it ensures that the job has no data associated with it.
