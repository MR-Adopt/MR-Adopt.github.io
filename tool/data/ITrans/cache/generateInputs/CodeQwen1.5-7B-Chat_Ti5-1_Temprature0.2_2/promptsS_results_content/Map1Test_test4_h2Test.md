## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("103", 3F);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair ("103", 3F) to the existing map. This ensures that the map contains three key-value pairs, which is a requirement for the test case.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("", 0F);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair with an empty string as the key ("", 0F). This ensures that the map contains a key-value pair with an empty string as the key, which is a requirement for the test case.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("null", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair with "null" as the key and null as the value. This ensures that the map contains a key-value pair with null as the value, which is a requirement for the test case.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("NaN", Float.NaN);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair with "NaN" as the key and NaN as the value. This ensures that the map contains a key-value pair with NaN as the value, which is a requirement for the test case.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Float> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("101", 1F);
    v01.put("102", 2F);
    v01.put("Infinity", Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair with "Infinity" as the key and positive infinity as the value. This ensures that the map contains a key-value pair with positive infinity as the value, which is a requirement for the test case.
