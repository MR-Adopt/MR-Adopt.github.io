## New input1:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the `v01` map. The key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "123" from 123L to 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair with a non-zero value.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 456L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the `v01` map. The key is "456" and the value is 456L. This ensures that the map contains at least two key-value pairs.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", 123L);
    v01.put("456", 0L);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it changes the value associated with the key "456" from 456L to 0L. This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair with a zero value.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<String, Long> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("123", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds a new key-value pair to the `v01` map. The key is "123" and the value is null. This ensures that the map contains at least one key-value pair with a null value.
