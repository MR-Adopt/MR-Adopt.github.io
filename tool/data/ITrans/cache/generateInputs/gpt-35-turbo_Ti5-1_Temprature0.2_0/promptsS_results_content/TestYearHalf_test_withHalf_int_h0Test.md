## New input1:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value falls within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` values are both 1, which is within the valid range of 1 to 2.

## New input2:
```java
    int year1 = 2022;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value falls within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` values are both 2, which is within the valid range of 1 to 2.

## New input3:
```java
    int year1 = 1999;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value falls within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` value is 1, which is within the valid range of 1 to 2. The `half2` value is 2, which is also within the valid range of 1 to 2.

## New input4:
```java
    int year1 = 2025;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value falls within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` values are both 1, which is within the valid range of 1 to 2.

## New input5:
```java
    int year1 = 2030;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` value falls within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (which is not specified in the code snippet). The `half1` and `half2` values are both 1 and 2 respectively, which are within the valid range of 1 to 2.
