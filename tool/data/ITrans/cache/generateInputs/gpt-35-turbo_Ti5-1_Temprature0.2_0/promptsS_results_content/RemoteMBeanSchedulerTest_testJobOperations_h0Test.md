## New input1:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
This is the original test input and it is valid because it creates a new job detail with the job key "job2" and the group key "GROUP_KEY". The job detail is stored durably, meaning it will persist even if there are no triggers associated with it.

## New input2:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
```
This input is valid because it creates a new job detail with the job key "job3" and the group key "GROUP_KEY". The job detail is stored durably, ensuring it persists even if there are no triggers associated with it.

## New input3:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", "GROUP_KEY2")).storeDurably().build();
```
This input is valid because it creates a new job detail with the job key "job2" and the group key "GROUP_KEY2". The job detail is stored durably, ensuring it persists even if there are no triggers associated with it.

## New input4:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job4", "GROUP_KEY2")).storeDurably().build();
```
This input is valid because it creates a new job detail with the job key "job4" and the group key "GROUP_KEY2". The job detail is stored durably, ensuring it persists even if there are no triggers associated with it.

## New input5:
```java
    JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job5", "GROUP_KEY3")).storeDurably().build();
```
This input is valid because it creates a new job detail with the job key "job5" and the group key "GROUP_KEY3". The job detail is stored durably, ensuring it persists even if there are no triggers associated with it.
