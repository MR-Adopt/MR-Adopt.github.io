## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where there are no segments in the tier. It ensures that the method handles the case of an empty tier correctly.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where there are a small number of segments in the tier. It ensures that the method correctly calculates the minimum number of segments to move when the total number of segments is less than the minimum bound.

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1_000_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where there are a large number of segments in the tier. It ensures that the method correctly calculates the upper bound of the minimum number of segments to move.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 65_536;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the total number of segments in the tier is exactly equal to the step size (2^16). It ensures that the method correctly calculates the upper bound of the minimum number of segments to move.

## New input5:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 50_000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests a general case where the total number of segments in the tier is between the minimum and maximum bounds. It ensures that the method correctly calculates the minimum number of segments to move based on the total number of segments in the tier.
