## New input1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 0;
```
This input is valid because the `year` parameter represents the year to be tested, and it can take any value from `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR`. In this case, `year` is set to the minimum value `0`.

## New input2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2021;
```
This input is valid because the `year` parameter represents the year to be tested, and it can take any value from `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR`. In this case, `year` is set to the current year `2021`.

## New input3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2000;
```
This input is valid because the `year` parameter represents the year to be tested, and it can take any value from `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR`. In this case, `year` is set to a leap year `2000`.

## New input4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1900;
```
This input is valid because the `year` parameter represents the year to be tested, and it can take any value from `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR`. In this case, `year` is set to a non-leap year `1900`.

## New input5:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 9999;
```
This input is valid because the `year` parameter represents the year to be tested, and it can take any value from `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR`. In this case, `year` is set to the maximum value `9999`.
