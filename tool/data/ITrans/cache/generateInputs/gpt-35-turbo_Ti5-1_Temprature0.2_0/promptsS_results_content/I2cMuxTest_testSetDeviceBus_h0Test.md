## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "0";
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `deviceBus` is set to "1". In this new input, we set the `deviceBus` to "0" to test if the method `setDeviceBus` can handle the lower boundary value of the valid range.

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "7";
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `deviceBus` is set to "1". In this new input, we set the `deviceBus` to "7" to test if the method `setDeviceBus` can handle the upper boundary value of the valid range.

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "3";
```
Explanation: In this new input, we set the `deviceBus` to "3" to test if the method `setDeviceBus` can handle a value within the valid range.

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "5";
```
Explanation: In this new input, we set the `deviceBus` to "5" to test if the method `setDeviceBus` can handle a value within the valid range.

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceBus = "2";
```
Explanation: In this new input, we set the `deviceBus` to "2" to test if the method `setDeviceBus` can handle a value within the valid range.
