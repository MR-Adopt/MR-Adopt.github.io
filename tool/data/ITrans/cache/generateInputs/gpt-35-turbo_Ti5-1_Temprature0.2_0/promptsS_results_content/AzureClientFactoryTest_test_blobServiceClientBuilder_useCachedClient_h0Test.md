## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `retryCount1` is set to 0, indicating that no retries should be performed.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `retryCount1` is set to a positive value (in this case, 3), indicating that the method should attempt the operation up to 3 times before giving up.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account2";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `ACCOUNT1` is set to a different value ("account2"), indicating that the method should return a different `BlobServiceClient` instance for a different storage account.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `retryCount1` is set to a higher value (in this case, 5), indicating that the method should attempt the operation up to 5 times before giving up.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `ACCOUNT1` is set to an empty string, indicating that the method should handle an empty storage account name correctly.
