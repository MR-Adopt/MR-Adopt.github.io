## New input1:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2005;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive). The `half1` is also within the valid range of 1 to 2.

## New input2:
```java
    int year1 = 2021;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2022;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive). The `half1` is also within the valid range of 1 to 2.

## New input3:
```java
    int year1 = 1995;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1995;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive). The `half1` is also within the valid range of 1 to 2. The `year2` is the same as `year1`, which is a valid scenario to test.

## New input4:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2024;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive). The `half1` is also within the valid range of 1 to 2.

## New input5:
```java
    int year1 = 1970;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 1975;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because the `year1` is within the valid range of `MIN_YEAR` to `MAX_YEAR` (inclusive). The `half1` is also within the valid range of 1 to 2.
