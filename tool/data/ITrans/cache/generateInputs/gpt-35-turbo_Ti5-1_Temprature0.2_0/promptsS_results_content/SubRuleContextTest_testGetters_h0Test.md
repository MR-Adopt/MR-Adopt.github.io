## New input1:
```java
    SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
    String NAME = "";
```
Explanation: In this test input, the `NAME` is an empty string. This is a valid input as the `generate` method in the `SubRuleContext.Generator` class does not have any restrictions on the value of `ruleName` parameter. It will create a new `SubRuleContext` object with an empty string as the rule name.

## New input2:
```java
    SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
    String NAME = null;
```
Explanation: In this test input, the `NAME` is set to `null`. This is a valid input as the `generate` method in the `SubRuleContext.Generator` class accepts an `Object` parameter for the `ruleName`. It will create a new `SubRuleContext` object with `null` as the rule name.

## New input3:
```java
    SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
    String NAME = "anotherName";
```
Explanation: In this test input, the `NAME` is set to "anotherName". This is a valid input as the `generate` method in the `SubRuleContext.Generator` class will create a new `SubRuleContext` object with the provided rule name. This input helps to test the functionality of generating a new context with a different rule name.

## New input4:
```java
    SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
    String NAME = "name";
    generator.generate(NAME);
```
Explanation: In this test input, the `NAME` is set to "name" and the `generate` method is called before any assertions. This input helps to test the functionality of generating a new context and adding it to the `nameToIds` and `idToName` maps.

## New input5:
```java
    SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
    String NAME = "name";
    generator.generate(NAME);
    generator.generate(NAME);
```
Explanation: In this test input, the `NAME` is set to "name" and the `generate` method is called twice before any assertions. This input helps to test the functionality of generating multiple contexts with the same rule name and adding them to the `nameToIds` and `idToName` maps.
