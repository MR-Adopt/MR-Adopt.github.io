## New input1:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` LocalTime to midnight (00:00:00), and fills the `lts` array with this value. It is a valid input as it tests the serialization and deserialization of LocalTime objects with a specific time value.

## New input2:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("23:59:59.999999999");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` LocalTime to the last moment of the day (23:59:59.999999999), and fills the `lts` array with this value. It is a valid input as it tests the serialization and deserialization of LocalTime objects with a specific time value.

## New input3:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("06:30:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` LocalTime to 6:30:00, and fills the `lts` array with this value. It is a valid input as it tests the serialization and deserialization of LocalTime objects with a specific time value.

## New input4:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("18:45:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` LocalTime to 18:45:30, and fills the `lts` array with this value. It is a valid input as it tests the serialization and deserialization of LocalTime objects with a specific time value.

## New input5:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("09:15:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
```
Explanation: This input sets the `now` LocalTime to 09:15:00, and fills the `lts` array with this value. It is a valid input as it tests the serialization and deserialization of LocalTime objects with a specific time value.
