## New input1:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is the same as the original test case and is valid because it represents a valid XML string with two projects, each having a language, scm, and location.

## New input2:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid because it represents a valid XML string with two projects, where the scm attribute of the first project is set to "Git" instead of "SVN".

## New input3:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "<JetS3t language=\"Python\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid because it represents a valid XML string with three projects, where the third project is added with a different language ("Python") and scm ("Git").

## New input4:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "<JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid because it represents a valid XML string with three projects, where the third project is added with the same language ("Java") but a different scm ("Git").

## New input5:
```java
    String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "<JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
```
This input is valid because it represents a valid XML string with three projects, where the third project is added with the same language ("Java") and scm ("CVS") as the second project.
