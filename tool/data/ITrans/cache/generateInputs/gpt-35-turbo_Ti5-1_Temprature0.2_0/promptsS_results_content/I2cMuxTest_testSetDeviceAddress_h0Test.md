## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x71";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x71", which is within the valid range of "0x70" - "0x77".

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x75";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x75", which is within the valid range of "0x70" - "0x77".

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x77";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x77", which is within the valid range of "0x70" - "0x77".

```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x6F", which is outside the valid range of "0x70" - "0x77".

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x80";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x80", which is outside the valid range of "0x70" - "0x77".
