## New input1:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new SequentialUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a different implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `SequentialUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it provides a different algorithm for generating UUIDs compared to the `RandomUuidGenerator` used in the original test case. This input allows us to test the behavior of the `generateId()` method with a different generator implementation.

## New input2:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new CustomUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a custom implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `CustomUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it allows us to test the behavior of the `generateId()` method with a completely different generator implementation. This input can help uncover any potential issues or limitations in the original implementation.

## New input3:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new TimeBasedUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses another alternative implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `TimeBasedUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it generates UUIDs based on the current time, which can be useful in scenarios where the order of UUID generation is important. This input allows us to test the behavior of the `generateId()` method with a time-based generator.

## New input4:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new SecureRandomUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a different implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `SecureRandomUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it generates UUIDs using a secure random number generator, which can be useful in scenarios where security is a concern. This input allows us to test the behavior of the `generateId()` method with a secure random generator.

## New input5:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new CombGuidUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses another alternative implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `CombGuidUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it generates UUIDs using a combination of timestamp and random number, which can be useful in scenarios where both uniqueness and ordering are important. This input allows us to test the behavior of the `generateId()` method with a comb GUID generator.
