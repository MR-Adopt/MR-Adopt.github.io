## New input1:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_YEAR;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the minimum valid value for the year field, which is Year.MIN_YEAR. The half field is set to 1, which is a valid value for the half-of-year field.

## New input2:
```java
    int year = Year.MAX_YEAR;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the maximum valid value for the year field, which is Year.MAX_YEAR. The half field is set to 2, which is a valid value for the half-of-year field.

## New input3:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests a typical year value, 2022. The half field is set to 1, which is a valid value for the half-of-year field.

## New input4:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests a leap year value, 2000. The half field is set to 2, which is a valid value for the half-of-year field.

## New input5:
```java
    int year = 2023;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests a non-leap year value, 2023. The half field is set to 2, which is a valid value for the half-of-year field.
