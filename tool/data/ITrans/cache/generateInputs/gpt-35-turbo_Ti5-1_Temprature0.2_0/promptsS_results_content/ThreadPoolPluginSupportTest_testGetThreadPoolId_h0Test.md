## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 1, 1, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 1, and a queue size of 1. This tests the behavior of the method when the thread pool is configured with minimal resources.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 10, 20, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size of 10 and a maximum pool size of 20. The queue size is set to 10. This tests the behavior of the method when the thread pool is configured with a larger number of threads and a larger queue size.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 5, and a `SynchronousQueue` as the work queue. This tests the behavior of the method when a `SynchronousQueue` is used as the work queue, which does not store tasks and requires an available thread to immediately execute the task.

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(100), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 5, and a `LinkedBlockingQueue` with a capacity of 100 as the work queue. This tests the behavior of the method when a `LinkedBlockingQueue` is used as the work queue, which can store a larger number of tasks.

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new PriorityBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 5, and a `PriorityBlockingQueue` as the work queue. This tests the behavior of the method when a `PriorityBlockingQueue` is used as the work queue, which orders the tasks based on their priority.
