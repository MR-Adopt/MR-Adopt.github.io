## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to 0, indicating that no retries should be performed. This will help verify if the program correctly handles the case where no retries are required.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to a positive value (in this case, 3), indicating that the program should perform the specified number of retries. This will help verify if the program correctly handles the case where retries are required.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to a negative value (in this case, -1), indicating that the program should not perform any retries. This will help verify if the program correctly handles the case where no retries are required.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to the maximum possible value for an `Integer`, indicating that the program should perform a very large number of retries. This will help verify if the program correctly handles the case where a large number of retries are required.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `ACCOUNT1` is set to an empty string, indicating an invalid storage account. This will help verify if the program correctly handles the case where an invalid storage account is provided.
