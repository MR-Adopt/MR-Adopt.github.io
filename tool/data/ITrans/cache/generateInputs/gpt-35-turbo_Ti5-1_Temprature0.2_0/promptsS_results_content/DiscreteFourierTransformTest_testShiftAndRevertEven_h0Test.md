## New input1:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(1, 1);
    original.set(0, 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 1x1 matrix with a single element set to 0. It is valid because it represents the minimum possible size for the matrix.

## New input2:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(3, 3);
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            original.set(i, j, i + j);
        }
    }
```
Explanation: This input creates a 3x3 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. It is valid because it represents a larger matrix with different values.

## New input3:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(2, 4);
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            original.set(i, j, i + j);
        }
    }
```
Explanation: This input creates a 2x4 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. It is valid because it represents a matrix with different dimensions.

## New input4:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(4, 2);
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            original.set(i, j, i + j);
        }
    }
```
Explanation: This input creates a 4x2 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. It is valid because it represents a matrix with different dimensions.

## New input5:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input creates an empty matrix with 0 rows and 0 columns. It is valid because it represents the smallest possible matrix size.
