## New input1:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of the value 0, which is a common edge case.

## New input2:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of the maximum possible value for a Long, which is another edge case.

## New input3:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a negative value, which may have different behavior than positive values.

## New input4:
```java
    Long value = random.nextLong();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a randomly generated Long value, which covers a wider range of possible inputs.

## New input5:
```java
    Long value = 1234567890L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a specific Long value, which can help identify any issues related to specific values.
