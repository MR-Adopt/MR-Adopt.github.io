## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `mockEvent` is `null`. It verifies if the program can handle the case when `add()` method is called with a `null` event.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `filter` is `null`. It verifies if the program can handle the case when `add()` method is called on a `null` filter.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `add()` method is called with a valid `mockEvent` on a valid `filter`. It verifies if the program can correctly add the event to the filter.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `add()` method is called twice with the same `mockEvent` on a valid `filter`. It verifies if the program can correctly handle duplicate events and add them to the filter.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `add()` method is called with a valid `mockEvent` and a `null` event on a valid `filter`. It verifies if the program can correctly handle a mix of valid and `null` events and add them to the filter.
