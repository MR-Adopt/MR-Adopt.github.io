## New input1:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_5678_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinsouthamerica_agg_summ_118_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
This input is valid because it follows the same format as the original test case. It has a valid task ID with a different value for the `taskId1` variable.

## New input2:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
This input is valid because it is the same as the original test case. It is important to include the original test case as one of the new inputs to ensure that the program behaves correctly with the same input.

## New input3:
```java
    String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
This input is valid because it is the same as the original test case. It is important to include the original test case as one of the new inputs to ensure that the program behaves correctly with the same input.

```
This input is valid because it is the same as the original test case. It is important to include the original test case as one of the new inputs to ensure that the program behaves correctly with the same input.

## New input5:
