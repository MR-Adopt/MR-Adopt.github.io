## New input1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
```
This input is valid because it is the same as the original test input `sql` without any modifications. It tests the scenario where the input `sql` is already in the correct format and does not require any normalization.

## New input2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 2);";
```
This input is valid because it is similar to the original test input `sql`, but with a different value for the `REMAINDER` parameter. It tests the scenario where the `REMAINDER` value is changed to a different valid value.

## New input3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 3);";
```
This input is valid because it is similar to the original test input `sql`, but with a different value for the `MODULUS` parameter. It tests the scenario where the `MODULUS` value is changed to a different valid value.

## New input4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3, OTHER_PARAMETER);";
```
This input is valid because it is similar to the original test input `sql`, but with an additional parameter `OTHER_PARAMETER` included in the `FOR VALUES` clause. It tests the scenario where there are additional parameters present in the `FOR VALUES` clause.

## New input5:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3) COMMENT 'Partitioned table';";
```
This input is valid because it is similar to the original test input `sql`, but with an additional `COMMENT` clause included after the `FOR VALUES` clause. It tests the scenario where there is an additional clause present after the `FOR VALUES` clause.
