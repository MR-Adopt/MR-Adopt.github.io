## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input (`i2cMux`, `deviceBus`) and the follow-up input (`i2cMux2`) is that when `setDeviceBus()` is called on `i2cMux` with a specific `deviceBus` value, the `getDeviceBus()` method called on `i2cMux2` should return the same `deviceBus` value.

## Explanation
The `setDeviceBus()` method sets the `deviceBus` value of the `i2cMux` object, and the `getDeviceBus()` method returns the `deviceBus` value of the `i2cMux2` object. In the original test case, `setDeviceBus()` is called with the `deviceBus` value, and then `getDeviceBus()` is called on `i2cMux2` to check if it returns the same `deviceBus` value.

To generate the follow-up input, we can create a new `i2cMux2` object and set its `deviceBus` value to the same value as the `deviceBus` value used in the source input. This will ensure that the `getDeviceBus()` method called on `i2cMux2` returns the expected value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "0";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "0" using `setDeviceBus()` method on `i2cMux`. Then a new `i2cMux2` object is created and assigned the same value using `Runtime.start()` method. This ensures that the `getDeviceBus()` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same value ("0") as the `deviceBus` value used in the source input.

## New input pair 1:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "7";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "7" using `setDeviceBus()` method on `i2cMux`. Then a new `i2cMux2` object is created and assigned the same value using `Runtime.start()` method. This ensures that the `getDeviceBus()` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same value ("7") as the `deviceBus` value used in the source input.

## New input pair 2:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "3";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "3" using `setDeviceBus()` method on `i2cMux`. Then a new `i2cMux2` object is created and assigned the same value using `Runtime.start()` method. This ensures that the `getDeviceBus()` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same value ("3") as the `deviceBus` value used in the source input.

## New input pair 3:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "5";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "5" using `setDeviceBus()` method on `i2cMux`. Then a new `i2cMux2` object is created and assigned the same value using `Runtime.start()` method. This ensures that the `getDeviceBus()` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same value ("5") as the `deviceBus` value used in the source input.

## New input pair 4:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "2";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "2" using `setDeviceBus()` method on `i2cMux`. Then a new `i2cMux2` object is created and assigned the same value using `Runtime.start()` method. This ensures that the `getDeviceBus()` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same value ("2") as the `deviceBus` value used in the source input.
