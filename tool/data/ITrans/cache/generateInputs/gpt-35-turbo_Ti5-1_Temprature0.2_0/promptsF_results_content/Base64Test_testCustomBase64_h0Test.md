## New input pair0:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0x00, 0x01, 0x02};
    String input2 = "AAECAw==";
```
The follow-up input `input2` is generated by encoding the source input `testDataBytes` using the `encode` method of the `Base64` class. The encoded value is "AAECAw==", which is the expected value for the follow-up input in order to pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0x7F, (byte) 0xFF, (byte) 0x80};
    String input2 = "f/IA";
```
The follow-up input `input2` is generated by encoding the source input `testDataBytes` using the `encode` method of the `Base64` class. The encoded value is "f/IA", which is the expected value for the follow-up input in order to pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{(byte) 0xAB, (byte) 0xCD, (byte) 0xEF};
    String input2 = "rLzv";
```
The follow-up input `input2` is generated by encoding the source input `testDataBytes` using the `encode` method of the `Base64` class. The encoded value is "rLzv", which is the expected value for the follow-up input in order to pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{(byte) 0x00, (byte) 0x7F, (byte) 0xFF};
    String input2 = "AH/+";
```
The follow-up input `input2` is generated by encoding the source input `testDataBytes` using the `encode` method of the `Base64` class. The encoded value is "AH/+", which is the expected value for the follow-up input in order to pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{(byte) 0x01, (byte) 0x02, (byte) 0x03};
    String input2 = "AQID";
```
The follow-up input `input2` is generated by encoding the source input `testDataBytes` using the `encode` method of the `Base64` class. The encoded value is "AQID", which is the expected value for the follow-up input in order to pass the assertion in the original test case.

The relation between the source input `testDataBytes` and the follow-up input `input2` is that the follow-up input is the Base64 encoded representation of the source input. The `encode` method of the `Base64` class is used to encode the source input, and the resulting encoded value is assigned to the follow-up input. This relation holds true for all valid input pairs, as the `encode` method consistently produces the expected Base64 encoded value.
