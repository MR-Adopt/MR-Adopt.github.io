## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`text`) is that the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` and `half` values with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year = 2020;
int half = 2;
CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (2020) and the `half` value (2) with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year = 2000;
int half = 1;
CharSequence text = "2000-h1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (2000) and the `half` value (1) with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year = 2025;
int half = 2;
CharSequence text = "2025-h2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (2025) and the `half` value (2) with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year = 1999;
int half = 1;
CharSequence text = "1999-h1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (1999) and the `half` value (1) with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year = 2030;
int half = 2;
CharSequence text = "2030-h2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (2030) and the `half` value (2) with a hyphen in between.
