## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `quarter1`) and the follow-up inputs (`year2`, `quarter2`, `amount`) is that the follow-up inputs are used to modify the source inputs in some way. Specifically, the `amount` is added to the `quarter1` value to obtain the `quarter2` value, while the `year1` value remains unchanged.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 1;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 3;
int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `amount` of 2 is added to the `quarter1` value of 1, resulting in the `quarter2` value of 3. The `year1` value remains unchanged.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 2;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 4;
int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `amount` of 2 is added to the `quarter1` value of 2, resulting in the `quarter2` value of 4. The `year1` value remains unchanged.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 3;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 1;
int amount = -2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the negative `amount` of -2 is added to the `quarter1` value of 3, resulting in the `quarter2` value of 1. The `year1` value remains unchanged.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int quarter1 = 4;
int year2 = 2023;
int quarter2 = 2;
int amount = 1;
```
This new input pair is the same as the original test case and satisfies the inferred relation. The `amount` of 1 is added to the `quarter1` value of 4, resulting in the `quarter2` value of 2. The `year1` value remains unchanged.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 2024;
int quarter1 = 1;
int year2 = 2024;
int quarter2 = 3;
int amount = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `amount` of 2 is added to the `quarter1` value of 1, resulting in the `quarter2` value of 3. The `year1` value remains unchanged.

## Code to generate follow-up inputs
```java
int year2 = year1;
int quarter2 = quarter1 + amount;
```
