## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the `executor` and `support` objects is that the `support` object is created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` method as one of its parameters.

## Explanation:
The `support` object is created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` method as one of its parameters. This means that the `support` object is dependent on the `executor` object and requires its `threadPoolId` to be passed during initialization.

To satisfy the inferred relation, we need to create a new `support` object using a different `executor` object but with the same `threadPoolId` as the original `executor` object.

## New input pair 0:
```java
@Test
public void testGetThreadPoolId() {
    ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
    ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
    Assert.assertEquals(executor.getThreadPoolId(), support.getThreadPoolId());

    // New source input
    ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor newExecutor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("newTest", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
    ThreadPoolPluginSupport newSupport = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), newExecutor, manager);
    Assert.assertEquals(newExecutor.getThreadPoolId(), newSupport.getThreadPoolId());
}
```

Explanation: 
In this new input pair, we create a new `executor` object called `newExecutor` with different parameters but the same `threadPoolId` as the original `executor` object. We then create a new `support` object called `newSupport` using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` method as one of its parameters. The `assertEquals` assertion verifies that the `newSupport` object has the same `threadPoolId` as the `newExecutor` object, satisfying the inferred relation.
