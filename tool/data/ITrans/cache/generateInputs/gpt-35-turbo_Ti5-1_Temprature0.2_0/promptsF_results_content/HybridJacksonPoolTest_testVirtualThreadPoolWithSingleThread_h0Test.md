## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `virtualPool` and the follow-up input `virtualPool2` is that they both need to be instances of the `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` class with the same capacity.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `virtualPool` is created with a capacity of 4. After acquiring a pooled resource and releasing it, the size of the `virtualPool` is checked to be 1. Then, a new `virtualPool2` is created with the same capacity of 4. The previously released pooled resource is then released again to `virtualPool2`. Finally, it is asserted that the same thread should get the same pooled resource when acquiring from `virtualPool2`.

To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `virtualPool2` needs to be created with the same capacity as the source input `virtualPool`. Therefore, for each new source input, the corresponding follow-up input should also be created with the same capacity.

## New input pair0:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `virtualPool2` is created with the same capacity of 0 as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair1:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `virtualPool2` is created with the same capacity of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair2:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `virtualPool2` is created with the same capacity of 10 as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair3:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `virtualPool2` is created with the same capacity of -1 as the source input `virtualPool`.

## New input pair4:
```java
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `virtualPool2` is created with the same capacity of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` as the source input `virtualPool`.
