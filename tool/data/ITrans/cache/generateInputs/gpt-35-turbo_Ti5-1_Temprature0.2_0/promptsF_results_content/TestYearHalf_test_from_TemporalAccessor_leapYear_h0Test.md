# Inferred Relation
Based on the given original test case and the code under test, we can infer the following relation between the source inputs (`date`) and the follow-up inputs (`year` and `expected`):

1. The `year` is obtained from the `date` by extracting the year field.
2. The `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date`. It is calculated as ((month - 1) / 6) + 1.

# New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
Explanation: 
In this new input pair, we set the `date` to July 1, 2022. The `year` is set to 2022, which is obtained from the `date`. The `expected` is calculated as ((7 - 1) / 6) + 1, which is equal to 2. This satisfies the inferred relation as the `year` is obtained correctly from the `date`, and the `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date`.
