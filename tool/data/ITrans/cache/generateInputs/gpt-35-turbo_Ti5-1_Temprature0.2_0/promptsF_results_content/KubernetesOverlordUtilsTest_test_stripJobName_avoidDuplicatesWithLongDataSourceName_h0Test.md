## Inferred Relation
The method `convertTaskIdToJobName` takes a `taskId` as input and converts it to a `jobName`. The `jobName` is generated by removing a specific pattern from the `taskId`, converting it to lowercase, and then appending a hash of the `taskId` to it. The resulting `jobName` is limited to a maximum length of 30 characters.

Based on the given test case, the inferred relation is that if two `taskId` values are different, their corresponding `jobName` values will also be different.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_5678_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinsouthamerica_agg_summ_118_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_5678_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinsouthamerica_agg_summ_119_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
In this new input pair, both `taskId1` and `taskId2` have the same prefix and suffix, but the numeric value in the middle is different. This ensures that the two `taskId` values are different.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_117_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
In this new input pair, both `taskId1` and `taskId2` have the same prefix and suffix, but the numeric value in the middle is different. This ensures that the two `taskId` values are different.

## Explanation
In both new input pairs, the `taskId` values are constructed in a way that ensures they have the same prefix and suffix, but different numeric values in the middle. This guarantees that the two `taskId` values are different. When these `taskId` values are passed to the `convertTaskIdToJobName` method, the resulting `jobName` values will also be different due to the hash appended at the end. Therefore, these new input pairs satisfy the inferred relation that if two `taskId` values are different, their corresponding `jobName` values will also be different.
