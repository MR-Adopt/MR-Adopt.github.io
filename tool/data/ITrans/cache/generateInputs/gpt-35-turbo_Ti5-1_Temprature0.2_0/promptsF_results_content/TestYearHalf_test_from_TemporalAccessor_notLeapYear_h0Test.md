In the original test case, the `date` object is used to obtain the year and half-of-year values. The `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object.

From the code of the `from` method, we can infer that the `YearHalf` object is created using the `of` method, which takes the year and half-of-year values as parameters.

Based on this information, we can infer the following relation between the source input (`date`) and the follow-up inputs (`year` and `expected`):
- The `year` value is obtained from the `date` object.
- The `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object.

To generate the follow-up inputs, we can use the same `date` object as the source input and calculate the `year` and `expected` values accordingly.

## New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = date.getYear();
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

In this new input pair, the `date` object is set to July 1, 2022. The `year` value is obtained from the `date` object using the `getYear()` method. The `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date` object.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case. The `year` and `expected` values are derived from the `date` object in a consistent manner.
