## Inferred Relation
The `parse` method takes an XML string as input and converts it into a `Map<String, Object>` using the `U.fromXmlMap` method. It then creates a new `XmlBuilder` object with the map key as the root element name. The `XmlBuilder` object is populated with the XML data and returned.

The `asString` method converts the `XmlBuilder` object back into an XML string using the `U.toXml` method.

Based on this information, the inferred relation between the source input (`XML`) and the follow-up input (`xmlBuilder2`) is that `xmlBuilder2` is the result of parsing the XML string `XML` using the `parse` method.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"SVN\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The new source input is the same as the original source input (`XML`). The follow-up input is obtained by parsing the XML string using the `parse` method. Since the XML string is the same, the resulting `XmlBuilder` object (`xmlBuilder2`) will also be the same.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String XML = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" + "<Projects>\n" + "  <underscore-java language=\"Java\" scm=\"Git\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://github.com/javadev/underscore-java/</Location>\n" + "  </underscore-java>\n" + "  <JetS3t language=\"Java\" scm=\"CVS\">\n" + "    <Location type=\"URL\">https://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</Location>\n" + "  </JetS3t>\n" + "</Projects>";
XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The new source input is different from the original source input (`XML`). The follow-up input is obtained by parsing the new XML string using the `parse` method. Since the XML string is different, the resulting `XmlBuilder` object (`xmlBuilder2`) will also be different.

## New input pair 2:

XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```

Explanation: The new source input is different from the original source input (`XML`). The follow-up input is obtained by parsing the new XML string using the `parse` method. Since the XML string is different, the resulting `XmlBuilder` object (`xmlBuilder2`) will also be different.

XmlBuilder xmlBuilder2 = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
```
