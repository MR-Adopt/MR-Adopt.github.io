## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list. Therefore, if two filters have the same events added in the same order, their `getEventsInternal()` method should return different lists.

Explanation: The new source input `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added in the same order. Therefore, the `getEventsInternal()` method should return different lists for `filter` and `filter2`, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list. Therefore, if two filters have the same events added in the same order, their `getEventsInternal()` method should return different lists.

Explanation: The new source input `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added in the same order. Additionally, `filter` has an extra event added after `mockEvent2`. Therefore, the `getEventsInternal()` method should return different lists for `filter` and `filter2`, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(null);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(null);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list. Therefore, if two filters have the same events added in the same order, their `getEventsInternal()` method should return different lists.

Explanation: The new source input `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added in the same order. Additionally, both `filter` and `filter2` have a `null` event added after `mockEvent2`. Therefore, the `getEventsInternal()` method should return different lists for `filter` and `filter2`, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(new FilterEventMock());
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list. Therefore, if two filters have the same events added in the same order, their `getEventsInternal()` method should return different lists.

Explanation: The new source input `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added in the same order. Additionally, both `filter` and `filter2` have a new event of type `FilterEventMock` added after `mockEvent2`. Therefore, the `getEventsInternal()` method should return different lists for `filter` and `filter2`, satisfying the inferred relation.
