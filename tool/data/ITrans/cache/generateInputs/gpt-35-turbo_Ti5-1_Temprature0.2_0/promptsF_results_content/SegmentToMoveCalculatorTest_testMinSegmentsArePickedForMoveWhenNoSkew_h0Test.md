## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 20,000. However, the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method calculates the minimum number of segments to move based on the `totalSegmentsInTier` value. Since the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 0 in this new input pair, the `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will return the minimum value of `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE`, which is a constant value. The `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will then calculate the number of segments to move based on this minimum value and other parameters. The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the scenario where the `totalSegmentsInTier` is 0.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 20,000. The `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method calculates the minimum number of segments to move based on the `totalSegmentsInTier` value. In this new input pair, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 100, which is a smaller value. The `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will return the minimum value of `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` because it is smaller than the calculated upper bound. The `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will then calculate the number of segments to move based on this minimum value and other parameters. The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the scenario where the `totalSegmentsInTier` is a smaller value.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1_000_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 20,000. The `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method calculates the minimum number of segments to move based on the `totalSegmentsInTier` value. In this new input pair, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 1,000,000, which is a larger value. The `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will calculate the upper bound based on the `totalSegmentsInTier` value and return it as the minimum number of segments to move. The `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will then calculate the number of segments to move based on this minimum value and other parameters. The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the scenario where the `totalSegmentsInTier` is a larger value.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 65_536;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 20,000. The `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method calculates the minimum number of segments to move based on the `totalSegmentsInTier` value. In this new input pair, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 65,536, which is exactly 2^16. The `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will calculate the upper bound based on the `totalSegmentsInTier` value and return it as the minimum number of segments to move. The `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will then calculate the number of segments to move based on this minimum value and other parameters. The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the scenario where the `totalSegmentsInTier` is equal to 2^16.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 50_000;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 20,000. The `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method calculates the minimum number of segments to move based on the `totalSegmentsInTier` value. In this new input pair, the `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 50,000, which is a value between 2^14 and 2^16. The `computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will calculate the upper bound based on the `totalSegmentsInTier` value and return it as the minimum number of segments to move. The `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` method will then calculate the number of segments to move based on this minimum value and other parameters. The follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it tests the scenario where the `totalSegmentsInTier` is between 2^14 and 2^16.
