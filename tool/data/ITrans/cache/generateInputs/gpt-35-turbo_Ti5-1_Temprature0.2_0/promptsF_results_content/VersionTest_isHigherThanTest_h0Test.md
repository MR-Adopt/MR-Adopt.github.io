## Inferred Relation
The `isHigherThan` method of the `Version` class compares two versions and returns `true` if the first version is higher than the second version. The comparison is done based on the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of the versions.

The inferred relation between the source input (`v1`) and the follow-up input (`v2`) is that the follow-up input should have a higher minor version number than the source input, while all other version numbers (major, revision, and build) should remain the same.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String v1 = "1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.1-A1";
```
Explanation: In the source input, the minor version is `0`, and in the follow-up input, the minor version is incremented to `1`. The major, revision, and build numbers remain the same.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0";
String v2 = "1.2.0";
```
Explanation: In the source input, the minor version is `1`, and in the follow-up input, the minor version is incremented to `2`. The major and build numbers remain the same.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.2.0-A1";
```
Explanation: In the source input, the minor version is `1`, and in the follow-up input, the minor version is incremented to `2`. The major and build numbers remain the same.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String v1 = "2.0";
String v2 = "2.1";
```
Explanation: In the source input, the minor version is `0`, and in the follow-up input, the minor version is incremented to `1`. The major and build numbers remain the same.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String v1 = "2.0-A1";
String v2 = "2.1-A1";
```
Explanation: In the source input, the minor version is `0`, and in the follow-up input, the minor version is incremented to `1`. The major and build numbers remain the same.

The follow-up inputs satisfy the inferred relation by incrementing the minor version number while keeping the major, revision, and build numbers the same. This ensures that the follow-up inputs will pass the assertion in the original test case, as the `isHigherThan` method will return `false` for all the follow-up inputs.
