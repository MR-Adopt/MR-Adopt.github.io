## New input pair0:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
    Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same key, value, and bias as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the `remove` method is called with `element2`, which has the same key, value, and bias as `element`. So, to satisfy the inferred relation, we need to create a follow-up input `element2` with the same key, value, and bias as `element`.
