## New input pair0:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2020";
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" and the expected `year` is 2012 and `half` is 1. In the new input pair, the `text` is "H2 2020" and the expected `year` is 2020 and `half` is 2. The relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `half` values in the `text` are used to create the expected `YearHalf` object. Therefore, by changing the `text` to "H2 2020", we can create a new follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation and passes the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H1 1999";
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" and the expected `year` is 2012 and `half` is 1. In the new input pair, the `text` is "H1 1999" and the expected `year` is 1999 and `half` is 1. The relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `half` values in the `text` are used to create the expected `YearHalf` object. Therefore, by changing the `text` to "H1 1999", we can create a new follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation and passes the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2022";
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" and the expected `year` is 2012 and `half` is 1. In the new input pair, the `text` is "H2 2022" and the expected `year` is 2022 and `half` is 2. The relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `half` values in the `text` are used to create the expected `YearHalf` object. Therefore, by changing the `text` to "H2 2022", we can create a new follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation and passes the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H1 2005";
    int year = 2005;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" and the expected `year` is 2012 and `half` is 1. In the new input pair, the `text` is "H1 2005" and the expected `year` is 2005 and `half` is 1. The relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `half` values in the `text` are used to create the expected `YearHalf` object. Therefore, by changing the `text` to "H1 2005", we can create a new follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation and passes the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2030";
    int year = 2030;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `text` is "H1 2012" and the expected `year` is 2012 and `half` is 1. In the new input pair, the `text` is "H2 2030" and the expected `year` is 2030 and `half` is 2. The relation between the source input and follow-up input is that the `year` and `half` values in the `text` are used to create the expected `YearHalf` object. Therefore, by changing the `text` to "H2 2030", we can create a new follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation and passes the assertions in the original test case.
