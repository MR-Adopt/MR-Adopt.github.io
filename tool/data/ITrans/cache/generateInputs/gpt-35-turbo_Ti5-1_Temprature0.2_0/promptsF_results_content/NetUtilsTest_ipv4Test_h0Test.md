## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 192168000001L;
```
Inferred relation: The method `ipv4ToLong` converts an IPv4 address represented as a string to a long value. The method `longToIpv4` converts a long value to an IPv4 address represented as a string. The conversion is done by splitting the string into four parts separated by dots and converting each part to a long value. The long value is then calculated by multiplying each part with a corresponding factor and summing them up.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `ipStr1` is set to `NetUtils.LOCAL_LOOPBACK_IP`, which is equal to `127.0.0.1`. The follow-up input `ipLong2` is set to `127000000001L`. To generate a new input pair, we can choose a different IPv4 address, such as `192.168.0.1`, and calculate its corresponding long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method. The resulting long value is `192168000001L`, which can be used as the follow-up input. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `ipv4ToLong` method converts the IPv4 address to the same long value as the original test case, and the `longToIpv4` method converts the long value back to the same IPv4 address.

```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 100000000001L;
```
Inferred relation: The method `ipv4ToLong` converts an IPv4 address represented as a string to a long value. The method `longToIpv4` converts a long value to an IPv4 address represented as a string. The conversion is done by splitting the string into four parts separated by dots and converting each part to a long value. The long value is then calculated by multiplying each part with a corresponding factor and summing them up.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `ipStr1` is set to `NetUtils.LOCAL_LOOPBACK_IP`, which is equal to `127.0.0.1`. The follow-up input `ipLong2` is set to `127000000001L`. To generate a new input pair, we can choose a different IPv4 address, such as `10.0.0.1`, and calculate its corresponding long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method. The resulting long value is `100000000001L`, which can be used as the follow-up input. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `ipv4ToLong` method converts the IPv4 address to the same long value as the original test case, and the `longToIpv4` method converts the long value back to the same IPv4 address.

    long ipLong2 = 255255255255L;
```
Inferred relation: The method `ipv4ToLong` converts an IPv4 address represented as a string to a long value. The method `longToIpv4` converts a long value to an IPv4 address represented as a string. The conversion is done by splitting the string into four parts separated by dots and converting each part to a long value.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `ipv4ToLong` method converts the IPv4 address to the same long value as the original test case, and the `longToIpv4` method converts the long value back to the same IPv4 address.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "0.0.0.0";
    long ipLong2 = 0L;

Inferred relation: The method `ipv4ToLong` converts an IPv4 address represented as a string to a long value. The method `longToIpv4` converts a long value to an IPv4 address represented as a string.
