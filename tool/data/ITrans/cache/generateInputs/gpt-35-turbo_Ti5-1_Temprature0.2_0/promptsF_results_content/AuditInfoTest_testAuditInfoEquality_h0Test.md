## Inferred Relation
The `hashCode()` method of the `AuditInfo` class uses the `Objects.hash()` method to calculate the hash code based on the values of the `author`, `identity`, `comment`, and `ip` fields. The inferred relation is that if two `AuditInfo` objects have the same values for these fields, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair 0:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo(null, "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo(null, "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same values for the `identity`, `comment`, and `ip` fields, which are `id`, `test equality`, and `127.0.0.1` respectively. The `author` field is `null` for both objects. Therefore, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair 1:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", null, "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", null, "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same values for the `author`, `comment`, and `ip` fields, which are `"druid"`, `"test equality"`, and `"127.0.0.1"` respectively. The `identity` field is `null` for both objects. Therefore, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair 2:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", null, "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", null, "127.0.0.1");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same values for the `author`, `identity`, and `ip` fields, which are `"druid"`, `"id"`, and `"127.0.0.1"` respectively. The `comment` field is `null` for both objects. Therefore, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair 3:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", null);
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("druid", "id", "test equality", null);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same values for the `author`, `identity`, and `comment` fields, which are `"druid"`, `"id"`, and `"test equality"` respectively. The `ip` field is `null` for both objects. Therefore, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair 4:
```java
AuditInfo auditInfo1 = new AuditInfo("", "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
AuditInfo auditInfo2 = new AuditInfo("", "id", "test equality", "127.0.0.1");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `auditInfo1` and `auditInfo2` have the same values for the `identity`, `comment`, and `ip` fields, which are `"id"`, `"test equality"`, and `"127.0.0.1"` respectively. The `author` field is an empty string for both objects. Therefore, their hash codes will be equal.
