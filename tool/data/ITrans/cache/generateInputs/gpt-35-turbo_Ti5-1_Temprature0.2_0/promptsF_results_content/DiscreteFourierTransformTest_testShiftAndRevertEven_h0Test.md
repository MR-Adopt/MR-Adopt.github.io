## New input pair0:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(1, 1);
    original.set(0, 0, 0);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(1, 1);
    shifted2.set(0, 0, 0);
```
Explanation: 
The original source input is a 1x1 matrix with a single element. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has only one element, the follow-up input should also have only one element, and the value of that element should be the same as the original matrix. In this case, the original matrix has the value 0, so the follow-up input also has the value 0.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(3, 3);
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            original.set(i, j, i + j);
        }
    }
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(3, 3);
    shifted2.set(0, 0, 0);
    shifted2.set(0, 1, 1);
    shifted2.set(0, 2, 2);
    shifted2.set(1, 0, 1);
    shifted2.set(1, 1, 2);
    shifted2.set(1, 2, 3);
    shifted2.set(2, 0, 2);
    shifted2.set(2, 1, 3);
    shifted2.set(2, 2, 4);
```
Explanation: 
The original source input is a 3x3 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has dimensions greater than 1x1, the follow-up input should have the same dimensions and the elements should be shifted according to the shifting logic in the `shift` method. In this case, the follow-up input is obtained by shifting the elements of the original matrix. The zero-frequency term (element at position (1,1)) is moved to the center, and the other elements are shifted accordingly.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(2, 4);
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            original.set(i, j, i + j);
        }
    }
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(2, 4);
    shifted2.set(0, 0, 0);
    shifted2.set(0, 1, 1);
    shifted2.set(0, 2, 2);
    shifted2.set(0, 3, 3);
    shifted2.set(1, 0, 1);
    shifted2.set(1, 1, 2);
    shifted2.set(1, 2, 3);
    shifted2.set(1, 3, 4);
```
Explanation: 
The original source input is a 2x4 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has dimensions greater than 1x1, the follow-up input should have the same dimensions and the elements should be shifted according to the shifting logic in the `shift` method. In this case, the follow-up input is obtained by shifting the elements of the original matrix. The zero-frequency term (element at position (1,2)) is moved to the center, and the other elements are shifted accordingly.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(4, 2);
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            original.set(i, j, i + j);
        }
    }
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(4, 2);
    shifted2.set(0, 0, 0);
    shifted2.set(0, 1, 1);
    shifted2.set(1, 0, 1);
    shifted2.set(1, 1, 2);
    shifted2.set(2, 0, 2);
    shifted2.set(2, 1, 3);
    shifted2.set(3, 0, 3);
    shifted2.set(3, 1, 4);
```
Explanation: 
The original source input is a 4x2 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has dimensions greater than 1x1, the follow-up input should have the same dimensions and the elements should be shifted according to the shifting logic in the `shift` method. In this case, the follow-up input is obtained by shifting the elements of the original matrix. The zero-frequency term (element at position (2,1)) is moved to the center, and the other elements are shifted accordingly.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(0, 0);
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    Primitive64Store shifted2 = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(0, 0);
```
Explanation: 
The original source input is an empty matrix with dimensions 0x0. The inferred relation is that when the original matrix has dimensions 0x0, the follow-up input should also have dimensions 0x0. In this case, the follow-up input is also an empty matrix with dimensions 0x0.
