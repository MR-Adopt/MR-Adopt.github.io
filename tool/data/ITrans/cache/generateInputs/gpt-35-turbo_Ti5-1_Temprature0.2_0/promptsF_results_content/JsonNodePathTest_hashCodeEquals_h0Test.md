## New input pair0:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("");
```

Inferred relation: The inferred relation is that if two `JsonNodePath` objects have the same `parent`, `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type`, then their hash codes will be equal.

Explanation: In the original test case, `a1` and `a2` are both created by appending the same path segment "a" to the same root `JsonNodePath` object. In this new input pair, `a1` and `a2` are both created by appending an empty string to the same root `JsonNodePath` object. Since the `parent`, `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type` are the same for both `a1` and `a2`, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair1:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("a.b");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("a.b");
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `a1` and `a2` are both created by appending the same path segment "a" to the same root `JsonNodePath` object. In this new input pair, `a1` and `a2` are both created by appending the same path segment "a.b" to the same root `JsonNodePath` object. Since the `parent`, `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type` are the same for both `a1` and `a2`, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair2:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("a[0]");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("a[0]");
```

Inferred relation: The inferred relation is that if two `JsonNodePath` objects have the same `parent`, `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type`, then their hash codes will be equal.

Explanation: In the original test case, `a1` and `a2` are both created by appending the same path segment "a" to the same root `JsonNodePath` object. In this new input pair, `a1` and `a2` are both created by appending the same path segment "a[0]" to the same root `JsonNodePath` object. Since the `parent`, `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type` are the same for both `a1` and `a2`, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair3:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("a/b");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("a/b");
```

Inferred relation: The inferred relation is that if two `JsonNodePath` objects have the same `parent`, `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type`, then their hash codes will be equal.

Explanation: In the original test case, `a1` and `a2` are both created by appending the same path segment "a" to the same root `JsonNodePath` object. In this new input pair, `a1` and `a2` are both created by appending the same path segment "a/b" to the same root `JsonNodePath` object. Since the `parent`, `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type` are the same for both `a1` and `a2`, their hash codes will be equal.

## New input pair4:
```java
    JsonNodePath root = new JsonNodePath(PathType.JSON_POINTER);
    JsonNodePath a1 = root.append("a%20b");
    JsonNodePath a2 = root.append("a%20b");
```
