## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`test2`) is that the `test2` object is created using the same `year` value as the source input and the `halfValue` is derived from the `half` value.

## Explanation:
In the original test case, the `test2` object is created using the `year2` value which is the same as the `year` source input value. The `halfValue` is set to 1, which is the value of the `half` source input. The `test2` object is then used to check if the year is a leap year.

To satisfy the inferred relation, we need to create the follow-up input (`test2`) using the same `year` value as the source input and derive the `halfValue` from the `half` value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 0;
    int halfValue = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, halfValue);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year` value is set to 0, and the `halfValue` is set to 1. This follows the inferred relation where the `test2` object is created using the same `year` value as the source input and the `halfValue` is derived from the `half` value.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 2021;
    int halfValue = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, halfValue);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year` value is set to 2021, and the `halfValue` is set to 2. This follows the inferred relation where the `test2` object is created using the same `year` value as the source input and the `halfValue` is derived from the `half` value.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 2000;
    int halfValue = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, halfValue);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year` value is set to 2000, and the `halfValue` is set to 1. This follows the inferred relation where the `test2` object is created using the same `year` value as the source input and the `halfValue` is derived from the `half` value.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    Half half = Half.H2;
    int year = 1900;
    int halfValue = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, halfValue);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year` value is set to 1900, and the `halfValue` is set to 2. This follows the inferred relation where the `test2` object is created using the same `year` value as the source input and the `halfValue` is derived from the `half` value.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    Half half = Half.H1;
    int year = 9999;
    int halfValue = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, halfValue);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year` value is set to 9999, and the `halfValue` is set to 1. This follows the inferred relation where the `test2` object is created using the same `year` value as the source input and the `halfValue` is derived from the `half` value.
