## Inferred Relation
The `isLowerThan` method of the `Version` class compares two versions and returns `true` if the first version is lower than the second version. The comparison is done based on the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of the versions.

The `valueOf` method of the `Version` class parses a version string and constructs a `Version` object. The version string should be in the format "major.minor.revision-build" or "major.minor-build" or "major-build". The major, minor, revision, and build numbers are extracted from the version string and used to create the `Version` object.

Based on the given test case, it can be inferred that the major, minor, revision, and build numbers are compared in the `isLowerThan` method to determine if one version is lower than the other.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1";
```
Inferred relation: The major version of `v1` is less than the major version of `v2`.

Explanation: In the original test case, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.10". The major version of `v1` is 1 and the major version of `v2` is also 1. However, the minor version of `v2` is greater than the minor version of `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is considered lower than `v2`. In the new input pair, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.1". The major version of `v1` is still 1, but the major version of `v2` is now 1 as well. Therefore, `v1` should still be considered lower than `v2`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
Inferred relation: The major version of `v1` is equal to the major version of `v2`, and `v2` has a build number.

Explanation: In the original test case, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.10". The major version of `v1` is 1 and the major version of `v2` is also 1. However, `v2` has a build number, which makes it greater than `v1`. In the new input pair, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.0-A1". The major version of `v1` is still 1, and the major version of `v2` is also 1. Additionally, `v2` has a build number, which makes it greater than `v1`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
Inferred relation: The major version of `v1` is equal to the major version of `v2`, and the minor version of `v2` is greater than the minor version of `v1`.

Explanation: In the original test case, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.10". The major version of `v1` is 1 and the major version of `v2` is also 1. However, the minor version of `v2` is greater than the minor version of `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is considered lower than `v2`. In the new input pair, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.0.1". The major version of `v1` is still 1, and the major version of `v2` is also 1. Additionally, the minor version of `v2` is greater than the minor version of `v1`. Therefore, `v1` should still be considered lower than `v2`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.0";
```
Inferred relation: The major version of `v1` is equal to the major version of `v2`, and the minor version of `v1` is equal to the minor version of `v2`.

Explanation: In the original test case, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.10". The major version of `v1` is 1 and the major version of `v2` is also 1. Additionally, the minor version of `v1` is equal to the minor version of `v2`. Therefore, `v1` is considered equal to `v2`. In the new input pair, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.0". The major version of `v1` is still 1, the major version of `v2` is also 1, and the minor version of `v1` is equal to the minor version of `v2`. Therefore, `v1` should still be considered equal to `v2`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "2.0";
```
Inferred relation: The major version of `v1` is less than the major version of `v2`.

Explanation: In the original test case, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "1.10". The major version of `v1` is 1 and the major version of `v2` is 1. However, the minor version of `v2` is greater than the minor version of `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is considered lower than `v2`. In the new input pair, `v1` is "1.0" and `v2` is "2.0". The major version of `v1` is still 1, but the major version of `v2` is now 2. Therefore, `v1` should still be considered lower than `v2`.
