## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `year2`) and the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) is that the `year3` and `half3` values should be the same as the `year1` and `half1` values respectively.

## Explanation
The `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method creates a new instance of `YearHalf` with the given `year` and `half` values. In the original test case, `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` is called to create a `YearHalf` object, and then the `withYear(year2)` method is called on that object to create a new `YearHalf` object with the `year2` value.

To generate the follow-up input, we can simply assign the same values of `year1` and `half1` to `year3` and `half3` respectively. This ensures that the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 2;
```

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2012;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 2;
```

In each of the new input pairs, the `year3` and `half3` values are set to the same values as `year1` and `half1` respectively. This ensures that the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the original test case.
