## Inferred Relation:
The `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method creates a `YearHalf` object with the given `year` and `half` values. The `with(Year)` method of the `YearHalf` class returns a new `YearHalf` object with the same `half` value but with the `year` replaced by the specified `Year` object.

Based on the original test case, it can be inferred that the `with(Year)` method replaces the `year` value of the `YearHalf` object with the `year` value of the specified `Year` object, while keeping the `half` value unchanged.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2000;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2005;
int year3 = 2005;
int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```
Explanation:
In this case, the `YearHalf` object is created with `year3` and `half3` values, which are the same as the `year1` and `half1` values. The `with(Year)` method is called with `Year.of(year2)`, which replaces the `year` value of the `YearHalf` object with `year2`. Since the `half` value remains the same, the follow-up input is `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2021;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2022;
int year3 = 2022;
int half3 = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```
Explanation:
Similar to the previous case, the `YearHalf` object is created with `year3` and `half3` values, which are the same as the `year1` and `half1` values. The `with(Year)` method is called with `Year.of(year2)`, which replaces the `year` value of the `YearHalf` object with `year2`. Since the `half` value remains the same, the follow-up input is `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 1995;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 1995;
int year3 = 1995;
int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```
Explanation:
In this case, the `YearHalf` object is created with `year3` and `half3` values, which are the same as the `year1` and `half1` values. The `with(Year)` method is called with `Year.of(year2)`, which replaces the `year` value of the `YearHalf` object with `year2`. Since the `half` value remains the same, the follow-up input is `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2023;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2024;
int year3 = 2024;
int half3 = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```
Explanation:
Similar to the previous cases, the `YearHalf` object is created with `year3` and `half3` values, which are the same as the `year1` and `half1` values. The `with(Year)` method is called with `Year.of(year2)`, which replaces the `year` value of the `YearHalf` object with `year2`. Since the `half` value remains the same, the follow-up input is `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 1970;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 1975;
int year3 = 1975;
int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```
Explanation:
In this case, the `YearHalf` object is created with `year3` and `half3` values, which are the same as the `year1` and `half1` values. The `with(Year)` method is called with `Year.of(year2)`, which replaces the `year` value of the `YearHalf` object with `year2`. Since the `half` value remains the same, the follow-up input is `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.
