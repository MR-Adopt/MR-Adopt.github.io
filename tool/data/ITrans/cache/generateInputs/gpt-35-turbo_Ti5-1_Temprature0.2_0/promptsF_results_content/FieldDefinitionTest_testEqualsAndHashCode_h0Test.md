## Inferred Relation
The `hashCode()` method of the `FieldDefinition` class calculates the hash code based on the `name`, `type`, and `deprecated` fields of the object. 

The inferred relation is that if two `FieldDefinition` objects have the same `name`, `type`, and `deprecated` values, their hash codes will be equal.

## Explanation
Based on the inferred relation, we can generate the follow-up input `other3` for the new source input `subject` as follows:

```java
FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING);
FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```

In this case, both `subject` and `other3` have the same `name` ("foo"), `type` (TokenType.STRING), and `deprecated` (false) values. Therefore, according to the inferred relation, their hash codes should be equal.

The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `subject` and `other3` have the same values for `name`, `type`, and `deprecated`, resulting in equal hash codes.
