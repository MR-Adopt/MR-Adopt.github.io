## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `job2Detail` and the follow-up input `job22` is that the `job22` is the key of the job detail `job2Detail`.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `job2Detail` is added to the remote scheduler using the `addJob` method. Then, the `job22` is used to retrieve the job detail from the remote scheduler using the `getJobDetail` method. The assertion checks if the retrieved job detail is equal to the original `job2Detail`.

Based on this, we can infer that the `job22` is the key of the `job2Detail` that was added to the remote scheduler.

## New input pair 0:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` is the key of the `job2Detail` that was added to the remote scheduler. The key values are the same as the original test case, so the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 1:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` is the key of the `job2Detail` that was added to the remote scheduler. The key values are different from the original test case, but they are still valid key values. The assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 2:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", "GROUP_KEY2")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", "GROUP_KEY2");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` is the key of the `job2Detail` that was added to the remote scheduler. The key values are different from the original test case, but they are still valid key values. The assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 3:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job4", "GROUP_KEY2")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job4", "GROUP_KEY2");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` is the key of the `job2Detail` that was added to the remote scheduler. The key values are different from the original test case, but they are still valid key values. The assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 4:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job5", "GROUP_KEY3")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job5", "GROUP_KEY3");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` is the key of the `job2Detail` that was added to the remote scheduler. The key values are different from the original test case, but they are still valid key values. The assertion in the original test case will pass.
