## Inferred Relation
The method `normalize` takes a `TypeLiteral` as input and returns a new `TypeLiteral` with the same content. If the input `TypeLiteral` is an instance of the `TypeLiteral` class, it is returned as is. Otherwise, a new `TypeLiteral` is created with the same raw type and argument types as the input.

## Inferred Relation Explanation
The `normalize` method is used to ensure that the `TypeLiteral` is in a consistent state and does not contain any references to outer objects. In the `normalize` method, if the input `TypeLiteral` is already an instance of the `TypeLiteral` class, it means that it is already in a normalized state and can be returned as is. Otherwise, a new `TypeLiteral` is created with the same raw type and argument types as the input.

In the given test case, the `normalize` method is called twice with different inputs (`input2` and `type2`). The expected result is that the normalized `TypeLiteral` should be equal to the original `TypeLiteral` (`type1` and `type3`).

## New input pair0:
```java
    Class input = String.class;
```
Follow-up input0:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<String>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(String.class);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalize` method returns a new `TypeLiteral` with the same raw type and argument types as the input. In this case, the input `TypeLiteral` is `TypeLiteral.listOf(String.class)`, so the follow-up input should be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Class input = Double.class;
```
Follow-up input1:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<Double>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(Double.class);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalize` method returns a new `TypeLiteral` with the same raw type and argument types as the input. In this case, the input `TypeLiteral` is `TypeLiteral.listOf(Double.class)`, so the follow-up input should be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Class input = Boolean.class;
```
Follow-up input2:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<Boolean>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(Boolean.class);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalize` method returns a new `TypeLiteral` with the same raw type and argument types as the input. In this case, the input `TypeLiteral` is `TypeLiteral.listOf(Boolean.class)`, so the follow-up input should be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Class input = Long.class;
```
Follow-up input3:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<Long>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(Long.class);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalize` method returns a new `TypeLiteral` with the same raw type and argument types as the input. In this case, the input `TypeLiteral` is `TypeLiteral.listOf(Long.class)`, so the follow-up input should be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Class input = Object.class;
```
Follow-up input4:
```java
    TypeLiteral<List<Object>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(Object.class);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalize` method returns a new `TypeLiteral` with the same raw type and argument types as the input. In this case, the input `TypeLiteral` is `TypeLiteral.listOf(Object.class)`, so the follow-up input should be the same.
