## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `ap` and the follow-up input `type` is that the `type` should be the same as the activity type of the `ap` object.

## Explanation:
In the original test case, the `addActivityParams` method is called with an `ActivityParams` object `ap`. The method checks if there is already an existing `ActivityParams` object with the same activity type as `ap`. If there is, it logs an error or info message depending on the activity type, removes the existing `ActivityParams` object, and then adds the new `ap` object.

To satisfy the inferred relation, we need to create a follow-up input `type` that matches the activity type of the `ap` object. This can be done by accessing the `activityType` field of the `ap` object.

## New input pair 0:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type2");
String type = ap.getActivityType();
```
Explanation: The activity type of `ap` is "type2", so we set `type` to "type2".

## New input pair 1:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type3");
String type = ap.getActivityType();
```
Explanation: The activity type of `ap` is "type3", so we set `type` to "type3".

## New input pair 2:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type4");
String type = ap.getActivityType();
```
Explanation: The activity type of `ap` is "type4", so we set `type` to "type4".

## New input pair 3:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type5");
String type = ap.getActivityType();
```
Explanation: The activity type of `ap` is "type5", so we set `type` to "type5".

## New input pair 4:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type6");
String type = ap.getActivityType();
```
Explanation: The activity type of `ap` is "type6", so we set `type` to "type6".
