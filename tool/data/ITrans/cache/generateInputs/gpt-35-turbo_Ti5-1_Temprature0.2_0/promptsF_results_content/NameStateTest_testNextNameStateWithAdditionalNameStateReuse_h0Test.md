## New input pair0:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    String key2 = "key";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is the same as the original source input pair. It satisfies the inferred relation because the `nameState2` is assigned the reference of `nameState`, which means they both refer to the same object. Therefore, when we add the `nextNameState` to `nameState` using the key "key", we can retrieve it using the same key "key2" from `nameState2`. The assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key1";
    String key2 = "key1";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is similar to the original source input pair, but with different keys. It satisfies the inferred relation because the `nameState2` is assigned the reference of `nameState`, which means they both refer to the same object. Therefore, when we add the `nextNameState` to `nameState` using the key "key1", we can retrieve it using the same key "key1" from `nameState2`. The assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key2";
    String key2 = "key2";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is similar to the original source input pair, but with different keys. It satisfies the inferred relation because the `nameState2` is assigned the reference of `nameState`, which means they both refer to the same object. Therefore, when we add the `nextNameState` to `nameState` using the key "key2", we can retrieve it using the same key "key2" from `nameState2`. The assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key3";
    String key2 = "key3";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is similar to the original source input pair, but with different keys. It satisfies the inferred relation because the `nameState2` is assigned the reference of `nameState`, which means they both refer to the same object. Therefore, when we add the `nextNameState` to `nameState` using the key "key3", we can retrieve it using the same key "key3" from `nameState2`. The assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    NameState nameState = new NameState();
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key4";
    String key2 = "key4";
    NameState nameState2 = nameState;
```

This new input pair is similar to the original source input pair, but with different keys. It satisfies the inferred relation because the `nameState2` is assigned the reference of `nameState`, which means they both refer to the same object. Therefore, when we add the `nextNameState` to `nameState` using the key "key4", we can retrieve it using the same key "key4" from `nameState2`. The assertion in the original test case will pass.
