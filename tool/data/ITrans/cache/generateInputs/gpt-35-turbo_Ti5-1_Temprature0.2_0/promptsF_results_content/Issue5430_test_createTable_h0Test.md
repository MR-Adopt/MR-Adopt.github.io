## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string,b bigint)";
```
To generate the follow-up input, we can remove the extra spaces between the column names and their data types in the `sql` string. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should have the same table schema as the source input, but with normalized spacing.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) STORED AS PARQUET";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string,b bigint) STORED AS PARQUET";
```
To generate the follow-up input, we can keep the `STORED AS PARQUET` clause in the `sql` string unchanged. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should have the same table schema and storage format as the source input, but with normalized spacing.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) PARTITIONED BY (c int)";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string,b bigint) PARTITIONED BY (c int)";
```
To generate the follow-up input, we can keep the `PARTITIONED BY (c int)` clause in the `sql` string unchanged. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should have the same table schema and partitioning as the source input, but with normalized spacing.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','";
```
To generate the follow-up input, we can keep the `ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','` clause in the `sql` string unchanged. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should have the same table schema and row format as the source input, but with normalized spacing.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) LOCATION '/path/to/table'";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string,b bigint) LOCATION '/path/to/table'";
```
To generate the follow-up input, we can keep the `LOCATION '/path/to/table'` clause in the `sql` string unchanged. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should have the same table schema and location as the source input, but with normalized spacing.

The follow-up inputs for the new source inputs satisfy the inferred relation by keeping the relevant clauses unchanged and only normalizing the spacing between the elements of the SQL statement.
