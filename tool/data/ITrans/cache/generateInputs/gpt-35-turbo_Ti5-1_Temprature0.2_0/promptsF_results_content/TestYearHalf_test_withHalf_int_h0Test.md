## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) and the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) is that the `year3` should be equal to `year1` and `half3` should be equal to `half2`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2007;
int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 1;
int year3 = 2007;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2007 and `half1` is set to 1. The `half2` is set to 1, which is the same as `half1`. Therefore, according to the inferred relation, the `year3` should also be set to 2007 and `half3` should be set to 1. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2022;
int half1 = 2;
int half2 = 2;
int year3 = 2022;
int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2022 and `half1` is set to 2. The `half2` is set to 2, which is the same as `half1`. Therefore, according to the inferred relation, the `year3` should also be set to 2022 and `half3` should be set to 2. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 1999;
int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 2;
int year3 = 1999;
int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 1999 and `half1` is set to 1. The `half2` is set to 2. Therefore, according to the inferred relation, the `year3` should also be set to 1999 and `half3` should be set to 2. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2025;
int half1 = 1;
int half2 = 1;
int year3 = 2025;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2025 and `half1` is set to 1. The `half2` is set to 1, which is the same as `half1`. Therefore, according to the inferred relation, the `year3` should also be set to 2025 and `half3` should be set to 1. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 2030;
int half1 = 2;
int half2 = 1;
int year3 = 2030;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `year1` is set to 2030 and `half1` is set to 2. The `half2` is set to 1. Therefore, according to the inferred relation, the `year3` should also be set to 2030 and `half3` should be set to 1. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
