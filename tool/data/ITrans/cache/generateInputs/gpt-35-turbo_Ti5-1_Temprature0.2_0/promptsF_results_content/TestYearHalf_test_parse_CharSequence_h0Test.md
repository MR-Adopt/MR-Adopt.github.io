## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`text`) is that the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year = 2020;
int half = 1;
CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (2020) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (1). This satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year = 1999;
int half = 2;
CharSequence text = "1999-H2";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (1999) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (2). This satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year = 2025;
int half = 1;
CharSequence text = "2025-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (2025) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (1). This satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year = 2005;
int half = 2;
CharSequence text = "2005-H2";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (2005) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (2). This satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year = 2030;
int half = 1;
CharSequence text = "2030-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (2030) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (1). This satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertion in the original test case.
