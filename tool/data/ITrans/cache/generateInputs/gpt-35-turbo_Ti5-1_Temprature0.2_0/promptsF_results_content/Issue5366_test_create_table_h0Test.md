## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 3);";
```

Explanation: The original test case asserts that the `normalizeSql` method should normalize the SQL string by removing unnecessary spaces and replacing single quotes with double quotes. In this case, the original `sql` and `newSql` are already normalized and have the same content, so they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 2);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 2);";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalizeSql` method should not modify the SQL string if it is already normalized. In this case, both `sql` and `newSql` are already normalized and have the same content, so they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8 , REMAINDER 3);";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalizeSql` method should not modify the SQL string if it is already normalized. In this case, both `sql` and `newSql` are already normalized and have the same content, so they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3, OTHER_PARAMETER);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 3, OTHER_PARAMETER);";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalizeSql` method should not modify the SQL string if it is already normalized. In this case, both `sql` and `newSql` are already normalized and have the same content, so they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3) COMMENT 'Partitioned table';";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 3) COMMENT 'Partitioned table';";
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `normalizeSql` method should not modify the SQL string if it is already normalized. In this case, both `sql` and `newSql` are already normalized and have the same content, so they satisfy the inferred relation.
