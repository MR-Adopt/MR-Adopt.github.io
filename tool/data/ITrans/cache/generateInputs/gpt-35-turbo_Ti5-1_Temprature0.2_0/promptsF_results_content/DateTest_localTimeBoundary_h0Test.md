## New input pair0:
```java
    LocalTime now = LocalTime.parse("00:00:00");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(20);
    LocalTime[] lts = new LocalTime[2];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 46, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 34, 44, 34, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 58, 48, 48, 46, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 };
    int size = 43;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `now` LocalTime is set to "00:00:00", which is the same as the original test case. The `lts` array is filled with `now` for both elements, just like in the original test case. The `body` byte array and `size` integer are also the same as in the original test case. Therefore, this new input pair will pass the assertions in the original test case.
