## Inferred Relation:
The `valueOf` method takes a version string as input and splits it into major, minor, revision, and build components. The major, minor, and revision components are split using the regular expression `SPLITTER_L_REGEX`, while the build component is split using the regular expression `SPLITTER_D_REGEX`. The major, minor, revision, and build components are then used to create a new `Version` object.

Based on the given test case, it can be inferred that the `isEqual` method of the `Version` class compares two `Version` objects and returns `true` if they are equal, and `false` otherwise.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0";
String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `v1` and `v2` have the same major, minor, and revision components, resulting in two `Version` objects that are equal. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true` for this input pair.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String v1 = "2.0";
String v2 = "2.0";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `v1` and `v2` have the same major component, resulting in two `Version` objects that are equal. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true` for this input pair.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String v1 = "1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `v1` and `v2` have the same major and build components, resulting in two `Version` objects that are equal. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true` for this input pair.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `v1` and `v2` have the same major, minor, revision, and build components, resulting in two `Version` objects that are equal. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true` for this input pair.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String v1 = "1.0-A1-B2";
String v2 = "1.0-A1-B2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `v1` and `v2` have the same major and build components, resulting in two `Version` objects that are equal. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true` for this input pair.

## Code to generate follow-up input:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = v1;
```
The follow-up input `v2` is set to the same value as `v1` to ensure that both `Version` objects created from `v1` and `v2` are equal. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the `isEqual` method returns `true` for this input pair.
