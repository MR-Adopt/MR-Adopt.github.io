## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. 

In the new input pair0, `subject` and `other` have different values (`0` and `1` respectively), and their hash codes are different. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the original test case pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. 

In the new input pair1, `subject` and `other` have different values (`Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` respectively), and their hash codes are different. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the original test case pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-10);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-11);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. 

In the new input pair2, `subject` and `other` have different values (`-10` and `-11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the original test case pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000001);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. 

In the new input pair3, `subject` and `other` have different values (`1000000` and `1000001` respectively), and their hash codes are different. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the original test case pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(2);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. 

In the new input pair4, `subject` and `other` have different values (`1` and `2` respectively), and their hash codes are different. This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the original test case pass.
