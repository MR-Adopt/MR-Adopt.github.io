## New input pair0:
```java
    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.parse("2020-01-12T12:13:14.123456789-03:30");
    JsonWriter jw = dslJson.newWriter(34);
    ZonedDateTime[] lts = new ZonedDateTime[3];
    Arrays.fill(lts, now);
    Class<ZonedDateTime[]> manifest = ZonedDateTime[].class;
    byte[] body = { 91, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 44, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 44, 34, 50, 48, 50, 48, 45, 48, 49, 45, 49, 50, 84, 49, 50, 58, 49, 51, 58, 49, 52, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 45, 48, 51, 58, 51, 48, 34, 93, 0, 0 };
    int size = 115;

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it uses the same `now` value and `lts` array as the source input. The `manifest`, `body`, and `size` variables are also the same as the source input. Therefore, the follow-up input will produce the same serialized JSON and the deserialized values will be equal to the original values, satisfying the assertions in the original test case.
