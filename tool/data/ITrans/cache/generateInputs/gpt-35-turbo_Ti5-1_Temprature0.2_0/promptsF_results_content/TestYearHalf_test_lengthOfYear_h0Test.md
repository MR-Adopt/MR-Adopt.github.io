## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 0;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(0, 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `lengthOfYear()` method returns 366 if the year is leap, and 365 otherwise. In this case, the year is 0, which is not a leap year, so the expected result is 365. The follow-up input `test2` is created using the same year and half values as the source input, and it is expected to return the same result as the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2022, 2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `lengthOfYear()` method returns 366 if the year is leap, and 365 otherwise. In this case, the year is 2022, which is not a leap year, so the expected result is 365. The follow-up input `test2` is created using the same year and half values as the source input, and it is expected to return the same result as the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `lengthOfYear()` method returns 366 if the year is leap, and 365 otherwise. In this case, the year is 2000, which is a leap year, so the expected result is 366. The follow-up input `test2` is created using the same year and half values as the source input, and it is expected to return the same result as the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(9999, 2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `lengthOfYear()` method returns 366 if the year is leap, and 365 otherwise. In this case, the year is 9999, which is not a leap year, so the expected result is 365. The follow-up input `test2` is created using the same year and half values as the source input, and it is expected to return the same result as the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = -100;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(-100, 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `lengthOfYear()` method returns 366 if the year is leap, and 365 otherwise. In this case, the year is -100, which is not a leap year, so the expected result is 365. The follow-up input `test2` is created using the same year and half values as the source input, and it is expected to return the same result as the original test case.
