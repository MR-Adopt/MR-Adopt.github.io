## New input pair0:
```java
    Version version1 = Version.valueOf("1.0.0");
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case. The source input `v` is "1.0.0" and the follow-up input `version1` is created by calling `Version.valueOf(v)`. The assertion `assertEquals(v, Version.stringOf(version1))` ensures that the `stringOf()` method returns the same string representation as the original source input `v`.
