## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `f3` and the follow-up input `f4` is that they have the same values for the `field`, `type`, `value`, and `dimension` properties.

## Explanation
The method `IsFalseDimFilter.of()` takes a `DimFilter` object as input and returns a new `IsFalseDimFilter` object. In the original test case, `f3` and `f4` are both `EqualityFilter` objects with the same properties. The `of()` method creates a new `IsFalseDimFilter` object with the input `field` as its property.

To generate the follow-up input `f4` for a new source input `f3`, we need to create a new `EqualityFilter` object with the same properties as `f3`. This ensures that the `field` property of `f3` and `f4` will be the same, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 0:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "", null);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `f4` is created with the same properties as the source input `f3`. Both `f3` and `f4` have an empty string as the `value` property, which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "123", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "123", null);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `f4` is created with the same properties as the source input `f3`. Both `f3` and `f4` have the string "123" as the `value` property, which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `f4` is created with the same properties as the source input `f3`. Both `f3` and `f4` have the string "hello" as the `value` property and "en" as the `dimension` property, which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `f4` is created with the same properties as the source input `f3`. Both `f3` and `f4` have the string "hello" as the `value` property and the same `field` property, which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.LONG, 123, null);
EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.LONG, 123, null);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `f4` is created with the same properties as the source input `f3`. Both `f3` and `f4` have the number 123 as the `value` property and the same `field` property, which satisfies the inferred relation.
