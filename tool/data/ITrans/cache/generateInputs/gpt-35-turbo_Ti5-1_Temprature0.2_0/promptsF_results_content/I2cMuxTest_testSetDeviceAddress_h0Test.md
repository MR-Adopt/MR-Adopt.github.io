## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input (`i2cMux`, `deviceAddress`) and the follow-up input (`i2cMux2`) is that when the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceAddress`, the `getDeviceAddress` method called on `i2cMux2` should return the same `deviceAddress`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x70";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `deviceAddress` is set to "0x70" and the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with this `deviceAddress`. Then, a new instance of `i2cMux2` is created. Since the `setDeviceAddress` method sets the `address` field in the `config` object of `i2cMux`, the `getDeviceAddress` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceAddress` ("0x70") as set in `i2cMux`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x71";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `deviceAddress` is set to "0x71" and the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with this `deviceAddress`. Then, a new instance of `i2cMux2` is created. Since the `setDeviceAddress` method sets the `address` field in the `config` object of `i2cMux`, the `getDeviceAddress` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceAddress` ("0x71") as set in `i2cMux`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x75";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `deviceAddress` is set to "0x75" and the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with this `deviceAddress`. Then, a new instance of `i2cMux2` is created. Since the `setDeviceAddress` method sets the `address` field in the `config` object of `i2cMux`, the `getDeviceAddress` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceAddress` ("0x75") as set in `i2cMux`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x77";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `deviceAddress` is set to "0x77" and the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with this `deviceAddress`. Then, a new instance of `i2cMux2` is created. Since the `setDeviceAddress` method sets the `address` field in the `config` object of `i2cMux`, the `getDeviceAddress` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceAddress` ("0x77") as set in `i2cMux`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x6F";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `deviceAddress` is set to "0x6F" and the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with this `deviceAddress`. Then, a new instance of `i2cMux2` is created. Since the `setDeviceAddress` method sets the `address` field in the `config` object of `i2cMux`, the `getDeviceAddress` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceAddress` ("0x6F") as set in `i2cMux`.

## New input pair 5:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x80";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `deviceAddress` is set to "0x80" and the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with this `deviceAddress`. Then, a new instance of `i2cMux2` is created. Since the `setDeviceAddress` method sets the `address` field in the `config` object of `i2cMux`, the `getDeviceAddress` method called on `i2cMux2` will return the same `deviceAddress` ("0x80") as set in `i2cMux`.
