## Inferred Relation:
The method `computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier` calculates the number of segments to be moved in a tier based on the level of skew between the historicals in the tier. It first calculates the total number of segments in the historicals. Then, it calculates the minimum number of segments to move and the number of segments to move to balance the tier. Finally, it returns the maximum of the minimum segments to move and the segments to move to fix the deviation, capped at the maximum number of segments allowed to be moved.

Based on the original test case, we can infer that the follow-up input should have the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` can be set to any positive value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
String tier2 = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = 10;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it has the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to a positive value, which ensures that the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
String tier2 = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = 5;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it has the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to a positive value, which ensures that the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
String tier2 = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", Collections.emptyList()), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = 3;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it has the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to a positive value, which ensures that the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
String tier2 = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("C", WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("D", WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = 7;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it has the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to a positive value, which ensures that the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Collections.emptyList();
String tier2 = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = Collections.emptyList();
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it has the same `tier` and `historicals` as the source input. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to a positive value, which ensures that the assertion in the original test case will pass.
