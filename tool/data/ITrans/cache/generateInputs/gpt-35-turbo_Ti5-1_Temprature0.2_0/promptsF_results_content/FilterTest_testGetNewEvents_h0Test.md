## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = null;
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: In the original test case, the `add` method is called on `filter` to add `mockEvent`. Since `mockEvent` is `null` in this new input pair, no event is added to `filter`. Similarly, `mockEvent2` is `null` and no event is added to `filter2`. Therefore, when `getNewEvents` is called on `filter2`, it should return an empty array, which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = null;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, both `filter` and `filter2` are `null`. Therefore, when `getNewEvents` is called on `filter2`, it should return an empty array, which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```
Explanation: In the original test case, `mockEvent` is added to `filter` and `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. Therefore, in this new input pair, `mockEvent` is added to `filter` and `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. When `getNewEvents` is called on `filter2`, it should return an array containing the `JsonEventObject` of `mockEvent2`, which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `mockEvent` is added to `filter` and `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. When `getNewEvents` is called on `filter2`, it should return an array containing the `JsonEventObject` of `mockEvent2`, which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, `mockEvent` is added twice to `filter` and `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. When `getNewEvents` is called on `filter2`, it should return an array containing the `JsonEventObject` of `mockEvent2`, which satisfies the inferred relation.
