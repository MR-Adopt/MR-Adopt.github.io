XmlBuilder xmlBuilder = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
String followUpInput = xmlBuilder.toXml();
```

Explanation: The follow-up input `followUpInput` is obtained by calling the `toXml()` method on the `xmlBuilder` object, which is created by parsing the source input `XML`. Since the `toXml()` method returns the XML string representation of the data stored in the `xmlBuilder` object, the follow-up input will be the same as the source input `XML`.
