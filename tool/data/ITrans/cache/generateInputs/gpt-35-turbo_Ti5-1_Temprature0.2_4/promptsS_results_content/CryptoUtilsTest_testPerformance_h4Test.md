## New input1:
```java
    Long value = 0L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of the smallest possible value of type Long.

## New input2:
```java
    Long value = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of the largest possible value of type Long.

## New input3:
```java
    Long value = random.nextLong();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a random value of type Long.

## New input4:
```java
    Long value = -1L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a negative value of type Long.

## New input5:
```java
    Long value = 1234567890L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of an arbitrary value of type Long.
