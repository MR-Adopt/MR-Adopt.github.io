## New input1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: This input creates an empty `Filter` object. It is a valid input as it tests the scenario where there are no events added to the filter.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Filter` object and adds one event (`mockEvent1`) to it. It is a valid input as it tests the scenario where there is only one event in the filter.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Filter` object and adds two events (`mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2`) to it. It then adds `mockEvent1` again. It is a valid input as it tests the scenario where there are duplicate events in the filter.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(null);
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Filter` object and adds two events (`mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2`) to it. It then adds a `null` event. It is a valid input as it tests the scenario where there is a `null` event in the filter.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
```
Explanation: This input creates a `Filter` object and adds two events (`mockEvent1` and `mockEvent2`) to it. It then adds a new `FilterEventMock` event. It is a valid input as it tests the scenario where there is a new event added to the filter.
