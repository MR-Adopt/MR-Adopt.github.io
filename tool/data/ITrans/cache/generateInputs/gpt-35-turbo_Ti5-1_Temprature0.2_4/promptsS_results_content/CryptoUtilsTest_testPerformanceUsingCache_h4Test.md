## New input1:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = 0L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the case where the `value` is the minimum possible value within the threshold range.

## New input2:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = 3L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the case where the `value` is within the threshold range and not at the boundaries.

## New input3:
```java
    long threshold = 5L;
    Long value = 5L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the case where the `value` is at the maximum possible value within the threshold range.

## New input4:
```java
    long threshold = 10L;
    Long value = 7L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the case where the `value` is within a different threshold range.

## New input5:
```java
    long threshold = 100L;
    Long value = 50L;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the case where the `value` is within a larger threshold range.
