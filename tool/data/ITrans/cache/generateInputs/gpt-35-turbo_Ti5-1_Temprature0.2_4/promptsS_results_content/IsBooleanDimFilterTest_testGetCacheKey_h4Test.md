## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with the same field name ("x"), column type (STRING), and a different value ("world"). This tests the scenario where the filter value is different.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with a different field name ("y"), the same column type (STRING), and the same value ("hello"). This tests the scenario where the filter field name is different.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, 123, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with the same field name ("x"), a different column type (INTEGER), and the same value (123). This tests the scenario where the filter column type is different.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with the same field name ("x"), the same column type (STRING), the same value ("hello"), and a different context ("en"). This tests the scenario where the filter context is different.

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, null, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with the same field name ("x"), the same column type (STRING), and a null value. This tests the scenario where the filter value is null.
