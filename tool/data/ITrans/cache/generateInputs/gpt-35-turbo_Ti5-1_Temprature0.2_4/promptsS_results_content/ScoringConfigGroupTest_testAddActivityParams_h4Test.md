## New input1:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type2");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type set to "type2". It tests the scenario where the `addActivityParams` method is called with a different activity type than the one already present in the `ScoringConfigGroup`.

## New input2:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type3");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type set to "type3". It tests the scenario where the `addActivityParams` method is called with a different activity type than the one already present in the `ScoringConfigGroup`.

## New input3:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type4");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type set to "type4". It tests the scenario where the `addActivityParams` method is called with a different activity type than the one already present in the `ScoringConfigGroup`.

## New input4:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type5");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type set to "type5". It tests the scenario where the `addActivityParams` method is called with a different activity type than the one already present in the `ScoringConfigGroup`.

## New input5:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type6");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `ActivityParams` object with the activity type set to "type6". It tests the scenario where the `addActivityParams` method is called with a different activity type than the one already present in the `ScoringConfigGroup`.
