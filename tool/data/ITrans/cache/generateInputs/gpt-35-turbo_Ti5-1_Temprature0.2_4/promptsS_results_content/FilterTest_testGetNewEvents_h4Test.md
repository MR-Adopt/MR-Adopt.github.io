## New input1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are setting `mockEvent` to `null` to test the behavior of the program when a `null` event is added to the filter.

## New input2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
```
Explanation: In this test input, we are setting `filter` to `null` to test the behavior of the program when a `null` filter is used.

## New input3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
```
Explanation: This test input is similar to the original test case, where we add a single event to the filter. This input is valid as it tests the behavior of the program when a single event is added.

## New input4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = null;
```
Explanation: In this test input, we add a `null` event (`mockEvent2`) to the filter after adding a valid event (`mockEvent`). This input is valid as it tests the behavior of the program when a `null` event is added after a valid event.

## New input5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
```
Explanation: This test input is similar to the original test case, where we add two valid events (`mockEvent` and `mockEvent2`) to the filter. This input is valid as it tests the behavior of the program when multiple events are added to the filter.
