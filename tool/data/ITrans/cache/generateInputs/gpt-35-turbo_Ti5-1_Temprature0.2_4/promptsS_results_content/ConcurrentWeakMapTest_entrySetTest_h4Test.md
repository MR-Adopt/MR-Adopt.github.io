## New input1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `HashMap` with three key-value pairs. The keys and values are of type `Integer`, which matches the type of the keys and values in the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(0, 0);
    anotherMap.put(1, 1);
    anotherMap.put(2, 2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `HashMap` with three key-value pairs. The keys and values are of type `Integer`, which matches the type of the keys and values in the original test case. The keys and values are also different from the keys and values in the original test case, providing a different set of entries to compare.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(10, 20);
    anotherMap.put(20, 30);
    anotherMap.put(30, 40);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `HashMap` with three key-value pairs. The keys and values are of type `Integer`, which matches the type of the keys and values in the original test case. The keys and values are also different from the keys and values in the original test case, providing a different set of entries to compare.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(100, 200);
    anotherMap.put(200, 300);
    anotherMap.put(300, 400);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `HashMap` with three key-value pairs. The keys and values are of type `Integer`, which matches the type of the keys and values in the original test case. The keys and values are also different from the keys and values in the original test case, providing a different set of entries to compare.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(-1, -2);
    anotherMap.put(-2, -3);
    anotherMap.put(-3, -4);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `HashMap` with three key-value pairs. The keys and values are of type `Integer`, which matches the type of the keys and values in the original test case. The keys and values are also different from the keys and values in the original test case, providing a different set of entries to compare. Additionally, the keys and values are negative numbers, which tests the behavior of the program with negative values.
