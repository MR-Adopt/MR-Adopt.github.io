```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("456", 456);
```

## New input2:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("789", 789);
```

## New input3:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("abc", 123);
    v01.put("def", 456);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new HashMap `v01` with two entries. The first entry has the key "abc" and the value 123, and the second entry has the key "def" and the value 456.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<String, Integer> v01 = new HashMap<>();
    v01.put("xyz", 789);
    v01.put("uvw", 987);
```
