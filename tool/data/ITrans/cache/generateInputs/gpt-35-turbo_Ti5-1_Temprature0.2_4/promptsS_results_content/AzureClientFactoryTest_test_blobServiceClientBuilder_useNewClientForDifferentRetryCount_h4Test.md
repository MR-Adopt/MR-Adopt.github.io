## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: In this test input, `retryCount1` is set to 0, indicating that no retries should be performed. This is a valid input as it tests the behavior of the method when no retries are allowed.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: In this test input, `retryCount1` is set to 3, indicating that the method should attempt the operation up to 3 times in case of failures. This is a valid input as it tests the behavior of the method with a specific number of retries.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: In this test input, `retryCount1` is set to -1, indicating that the method should use the default retry count specified in the `config.getMaxTries()` method. This is a valid input as it tests the behavior of the method when the retry count is set to the default value.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
```
Explanation: In this test input, `retryCount1` is set to 5, indicating that the method should attempt the operation up to 5 times in case of failures. The `ACCOUNT1` is set to an empty string, which is a valid input as it tests the behavior of the method when the storage account name is empty.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account123";
```
Explanation: In this test input, `retryCount1` is set to null, indicating that the method should use the default retry count specified in the `config.getMaxTries()` method. The `ACCOUNT1` is set to "account123", which is a valid input as it tests the behavior of the method with a different storage account name.
