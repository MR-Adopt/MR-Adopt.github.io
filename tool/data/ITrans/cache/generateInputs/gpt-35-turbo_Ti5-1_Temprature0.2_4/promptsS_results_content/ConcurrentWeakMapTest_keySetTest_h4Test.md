## New input1:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(1, 2);
    anotherMap.put(2, 3);
    anotherMap.put(3, 4);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `anotherMap` with three key-value pairs, where the keys are integers and the values are integers. The keys and values are different from the original test case, allowing us to test the behavior of the `keySet()` method with different input values.

## New input2:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(0, 0);
    anotherMap.put(1, 1);
    anotherMap.put(2, 2);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `anotherMap` with three key-value pairs, where the keys are integers and the values are integers. The keys and values are different from the original test case, allowing us to test the behavior of the `keySet()` method with different input values.

## New input3:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(10, 20);
    anotherMap.put(20, 30);
    anotherMap.put(30, 40);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `anotherMap` with three key-value pairs, where the keys are integers and the values are integers. The keys and values are different from the original test case, allowing us to test the behavior of the `keySet()` method with different input values.

## New input4:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(100, 200);
    anotherMap.put(200, 300);
    anotherMap.put(300, 400);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `anotherMap` with three key-value pairs, where the keys are integers and the values are integers. The keys and values are different from the original test case, allowing us to test the behavior of the `keySet()` method with different input values.

## New input5:
```java
    Map<Integer, Integer> anotherMap = new HashMap<>();
    anotherMap.put(-1, -2);
    anotherMap.put(-2, -3);
    anotherMap.put(-3, -4);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a `anotherMap` with three key-value pairs, where the keys are integers and the values are integers. The keys and values are different from the original test case, allowing us to test the behavior of the `keySet()` method with different input values. Additionally, this input includes negative integers as keys and values, which can help test the behavior of the `keySet()` method with negative input values.
