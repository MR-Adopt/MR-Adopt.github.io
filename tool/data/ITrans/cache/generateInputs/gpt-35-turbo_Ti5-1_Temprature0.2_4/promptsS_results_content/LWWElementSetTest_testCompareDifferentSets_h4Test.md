## New input1:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
```
This is the original test input and it is valid because it creates an element with a unique key "key1" and a timestamp of 1.

## New input2:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", 0, bias);
```
This input is valid because it creates an element with a unique key "key1" and a timestamp of 0. It tests the scenario where the timestamp is set to the minimum value.

## New input3:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", Integer.MAX_VALUE, bias);
```
This input is valid because it creates an element with a unique key "key1" and a timestamp of the maximum integer value. It tests the scenario where the timestamp is set to the maximum value.

## New input4:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", -1, bias);
```
This input is valid because it creates an element with a unique key "key1" and a negative timestamp. It tests the scenario where the timestamp is set to a negative value.

## New input5:
```java
    Element element1 = new Element("key1", 100, bias);
```
This input is valid because it creates an element with a unique key "key1" and a positive timestamp. It tests the scenario where the timestamp is set to a positive value.
