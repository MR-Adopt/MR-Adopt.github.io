## New input1:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module1";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this input, the symptom name is set to "fever" and the module name is set to "module1". Both values are valid and can be used to test the functionality of the `onSet` and `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` methods.

## New input2:
```java
    String name = "cough";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module2";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this input, the symptom name is set to "cough" and the module name is set to "module2". Both values are valid and can be used to test the functionality of the `onSet` and `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` methods.

## New input3:
```java
    String name = "headache";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module3";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this input, the symptom name is set to "headache" and the module name is set to "module3". Both values are valid and can be used to test the functionality of the `onSet` and `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` methods.

## New input4:
```java
    String name = "fatigue";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module4";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this input, the symptom name is set to "fatigue" and the module name is set to "module4". Both values are valid and can be used to test the functionality of the `onSet` and `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` methods.

## New input5:
```java
    String name = "nausea";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module5";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
```
Explanation: In this input, the symptom name is set to "nausea" and the module name is set to "module5". Both values are valid and can be used to test the functionality of the `onSet` and `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` methods.

These new inputs explore different symptom names and module names to ensure that the `onSet` and `getSymptomLastUpdatedTime` methods handle different scenarios correctly.
