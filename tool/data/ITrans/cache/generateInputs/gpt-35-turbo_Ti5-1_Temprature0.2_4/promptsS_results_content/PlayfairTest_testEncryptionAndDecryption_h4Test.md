## New input1:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "HELLO";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a different plaintext value. It ensures that the encryption and decryption methods can handle a different input string.

## New input2:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "WORLD";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a different plaintext value. It ensures that the encryption and decryption methods can handle a different input string.

## New input3:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "JAVA";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a different plaintext value. It ensures that the encryption and decryption methods can handle a different input string.

## New input4:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "PROGRAMMING";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a different plaintext value. It ensures that the encryption and decryption methods can handle a different input string.

## New input5:
```java
    PlayfairCipher playfairCipher = new PlayfairCipher("KEYWORD");
    String plaintext = "TESTING";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the encryption and decryption of a different plaintext value. It ensures that the encryption and decryption methods can handle a different input string.
