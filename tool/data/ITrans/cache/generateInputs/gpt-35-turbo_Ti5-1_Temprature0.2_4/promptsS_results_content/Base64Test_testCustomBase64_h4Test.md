## New input1:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `data` array is empty. It ensures that the `encode` method can handle empty input correctly.

## New input2:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0x00, 0x01, 0x02};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `data` array has a length of 3. It ensures that the `encode` method can handle input with a length that is not a multiple of 3 correctly.

## New input3:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0x7F, (byte) 0x80, (byte) 0xFF};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `data` array contains bytes with the maximum and minimum values. It ensures that the `encode` method can handle all possible byte values correctly.

## New input4:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `data` array has a length of 4. It ensures that the `encode` method can handle input with a length that is a multiple of 3 correctly.

## New input5:
```java
    byte[] testDataBytes = new byte[]{0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05};
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `data` array has a length greater than 3 and not a multiple of 3. It ensures that the `encode` method can handle input with a length that is not a multiple of 3 correctly.
