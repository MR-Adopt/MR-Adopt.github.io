## New input1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new instance of `FileInputStream` which implements the `Closeable` interface. It tests the ability of the `ResourceHolder` to handle different types of `Closeable` resources.

## New input2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new instance of `Socket` which implements the `Closeable` interface. It tests the ability of the `ResourceHolder` to handle different types of `Closeable` resources.

## New input3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new instance of `ByteArrayOutputStream` which implements the `Closeable` interface. It tests the ability of the `ResourceHolder` to handle different types of `Closeable` resources.

## New input4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new PipedInputStream();
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new instance of `PipedInputStream` which implements the `Closeable` interface. It tests the ability of the `ResourceHolder` to handle different types of `Closeable` resources.

## New input5:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FilterInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            super.close();
            System.out.println("Closing FilterInputStream");
        }
    };
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new instance of a custom `FilterInputStream` which extends `FilterInputStream` and overrides the `close()` method. It tests the ability of the `ResourceHolder` to handle custom implementations of `Closeable` resources.
