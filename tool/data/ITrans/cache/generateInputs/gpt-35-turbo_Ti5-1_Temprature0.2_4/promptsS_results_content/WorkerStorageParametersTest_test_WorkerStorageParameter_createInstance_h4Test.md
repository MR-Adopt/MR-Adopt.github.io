## New input1:
```java
    long l = 0;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is set to the minimum value of 0.

## New input2:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is set to the maximum value of `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

## New input3:
```java
    long l = 100000000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests a positive value for `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` that is not the minimum or maximum value.

## New input4:
```java
    long l = -1;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is set to -1, which is a special case handled in the `createInstance` method.

## New input5:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests a positive value for `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` that is not the minimum or maximum value. It is different from the previous input to cover a wider range of test scenarios.
