## New input1:
```java
    String randomString = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the input string is empty. It is important to verify that the program can handle empty strings correctly.

## New input2:
```java
    String randomString = "1234567890";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the input string contains only numeric characters. It is important to verify that the program can handle numeric strings correctly.

## New input3:
```java
    String randomString = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the input string contains all lowercase and uppercase alphabets. It is important to verify that the program can handle strings with a mix of lowercase and uppercase characters correctly.

## New input4:
```java
    String randomString = " !@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]:\";'<>?,./";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the input string contains special characters. It is important to verify that the program can handle strings with special characters correctly.

## New input5:
```java
    String randomString = "randomStringrandomStringrandomStringrandomStringrandomStringrandomStringrandomStringrandomStringrandomStringrandomString";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the input string is very long. It is important to verify that the program can handle long strings correctly without any performance issues.
