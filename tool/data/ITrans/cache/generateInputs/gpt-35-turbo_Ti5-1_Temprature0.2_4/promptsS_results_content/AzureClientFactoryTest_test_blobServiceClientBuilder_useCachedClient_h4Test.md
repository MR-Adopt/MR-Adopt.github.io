## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to 0, indicating that no retries should be performed.

## New input2:
```java

    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to a positive value, indicating the number of retries to be performed.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to the maximum possible value, indicating that the maximum number of retries should be performed.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to a negative value, indicating that no retries should be performed.

## New input5:
```java

    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount1` is set to null, indicating that the default retry count should be used.
