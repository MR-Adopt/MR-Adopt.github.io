## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
```
Explanation: This input represents the scenario where there are no segments in the tier. It is a valid test input as it tests the behavior of the method when there are no segments to move.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100;
```
Explanation: This input represents a small number of segments in the tier. It is a valid test input as it tests the behavior of the method when there are only a few segments to move.

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1_000_000;
```
Explanation: This input represents a large number of segments in the tier. It is a valid test input as it tests the behavior of the method when there are a significant number of segments to move.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 65_536;
```
Explanation: This input represents the upper bound of the step size for calculating the minimum segments to move. It is a valid test input as it tests the behavior of the method when the upper bound condition is met.

## New input5:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 10_000;
```
Explanation: This input represents a moderate number of segments in the tier. It is a valid test input as it tests the behavior of the method with a typical number of segments to move.
