## New input1:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with a different key ("key2") and a different value (2). This allows us to test the `remove` method with a different element than the one added to the set.

## New input2:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with the same key ("key1") but a different value (2). This allows us to test the `remove` method with an element that has the same key but a different value than the one added to the set.

## New input3:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with the same key ("key1") and the same value (1), but with a different bias (null). This allows us to test the `remove` method with an element that has the same key and value, but a different bias than the one added to the set.

## New input4:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new `Element` object with a different key ("key2") but the same value (1). This allows us to test the `remove` method with a different element than the one added to the set.

## New input5:
```java
    Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
    set.add(element);
    set.remove(element);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it adds the `element` to the set before removing it. This allows us to test the `remove` method with an element that was previously added to the set.
