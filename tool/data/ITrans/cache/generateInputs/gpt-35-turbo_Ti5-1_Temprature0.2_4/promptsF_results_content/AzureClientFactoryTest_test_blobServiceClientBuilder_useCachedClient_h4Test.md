## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are set to the same value of 0. Since the `retryCount` parameter is used as a key in the `cachedBlobServiceClients` map, setting both values to 0 will result in the same key being used to retrieve the `BlobServiceClient` from the map. Therefore, the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are set to the same value of 3. Similar to the previous case, setting both values to 3 will result in the same key being used to retrieve the `BlobServiceClient` from the map, ensuring that the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are set to the same value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Again, this will result in the same key being used to retrieve the `BlobServiceClient` from the map, ensuring that the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are set to the same value of -1. As before, this will result in the same key being used to retrieve the `BlobServiceClient` from the map, ensuring that the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = null;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = null;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are set to `null`. In the `getBlobServiceClient` method, if `retryCount` is `null`, it is replaced with `config.getMaxTries()`. Since both `retryCount1` and `retryCount2` are `null`, they will be replaced with the same value, resulting in the same key being used to retrieve the `BlobServiceClient` from the map. Therefore, the assertion in the original test case will pass.
