## New input pair0:
```java
    IntArrayList a = new IntArrayList();
    boolean trimFlag = true;
    boolean trimFlag2 = false;
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `trimFlag2` should be the opposite of the source input `trimFlag`.

Explanation: In the original test case, the `trimFlag` is set to `false`, which means the `extractValues` method will return the entire `_data` array. To satisfy the assertion, the follow-up input `trimFlag2` should be set to `true`, which will result in a smaller extracted array.
