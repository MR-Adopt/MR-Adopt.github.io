## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = Year.MIN_YEAR;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created using the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values will be equal to each other. In the original test case, `test` and `test2` are created using the same `year` and `half` values, and they are asserted to be equal. 

In this new input pair, we use the minimum year value (`Year.MIN_YEAR`) and the first half of the year (`1`) as the source input. The follow-up input is created by calling the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values. Since the `year` and `half` values are the same as in the original test case, the follow-up input will also pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = Year.MAX_YEAR;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created using the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values will be equal to each other. In the original test case, `test` and `test2` are created using the same `year` and `half` values, and they are asserted to be equal. 

In this new input pair, we use the maximum year value (`Year.MAX_YEAR`) and the second half of the year (`2`) as the source input. The follow-up input is created by calling the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values. Since the `year` and `half` values are the same as in the original test case, the follow-up input will also pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 1;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created using the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values will be equal to each other. In the original test case, `test` and `test2` are created using the same `year` and `half` values, and they are asserted to be equal. 

In this new input pair, we use the year `2022` and the first half of the year (`1`) as the source input. The follow-up input is created by calling the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values. Since the `year` and `half` values are the same as in the original test case, the follow-up input will also pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2023;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created using the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values will be equal to each other. In the original test case, `test` and `test2` are created using the same `year` and `half` values, and they are asserted to be equal. 

In this new input pair, we use the year `2023` and the second half of the year (`2`) as the source input. The follow-up input is created by calling the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values. Since the `year` and `half` values are the same as in the original test case, the follow-up input will also pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the `YearHalf` object created using the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values will be equal to each other. In the original test case, `test` and `test2` are created using the same `year` and `half` values, and they are asserted to be equal. 

In this new input pair, we use the year `2000` and the second half of the year (`2`) as the source input. The follow-up input is created by calling the `of` method with the same `year` and `half` values. Since the `year` and `half` values are the same as in the original test case, the follow-up input will also pass the assertions in the original test case.
