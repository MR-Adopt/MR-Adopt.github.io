## New input pair0:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new TestExecuteAwarePlugin();
    String pluginId = "TestExecuteAwarePlugin";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `pluginId` is set to the same value as the plugin's id. This ensures that when `getPlugin()` is called with the `pluginId`, it will return the same plugin object that was registered.

## New input pair1:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = new AnotherPlugin();
    String pluginId = "AnotherPlugin";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `pluginId` is set to the same value as the plugin's id. This ensures that when `getPlugin()` is called with the `pluginId`, it will return the same plugin object that was registered.

## New input pair2:
```java
    ThreadPoolPlugin plugin = null;
    String pluginId = "TestExecuteAwarePlugin";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `pluginId` is set to the same value as the plugin's id. Since the plugin is `null`, calling `getPlugin()` with the `pluginId` will return an empty `Optional`.
