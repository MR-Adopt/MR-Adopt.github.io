## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`text`) is that the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` and `half` values with a hyphen in between. The `year` value is converted to a string and the `half` value is appended as a string with a "h" prefix.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2020-h2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (2020) and the `half` value (2) with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1999-h1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (1999) and the `half` value (1) with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year = 2025;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2025-h2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (2025) and the `half` value (2) with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2000-h1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (2000) and the `half` value (1) with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2022-h2";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` value (2022) and the `half` value (2) with a hyphen in between.

The follow-up inputs for the new source inputs are constructed by following the inferred relation, which is to concatenate the `year` and `half` values with a hyphen in between. The `year` value is converted to a string and the `half` value is appended as a string with a "h" prefix. This ensures that the follow-up inputs adhere to the inferred relation and pass the assertions in the original test case.
