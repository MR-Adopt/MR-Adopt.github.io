## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```

Explanation: 
In the original test case, the `filter` object is created and an event `mockEvent` is added to it. Then, the `filter2` object is created and an event `mockEvent2` is added to it. The `getNewEvents()` method is called on `filter2` and it returns an array containing the `jsonEventObject` of `mockEvent`. 

In this new input pair, we have set `mockEvent` to `null` and created an empty `filter` object. We have also created `mockEvent2` and `filter2` objects similar to the original test case. Since `mockEvent` is `null` and `filter` is empty, the `getNewEvents()` method on `filter2` should return an empty array, which satisfies the inferred relation. 

```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    Object[] events1 = filter2.getNewEvents();
    assertArrayEquals(new Object[] {}, events1);
}
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```

In this new input pair, we have set `filter` to `null` and created `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` objects similar to the original test case. Since `filter` is `null`, the `getNewEvents()` method on `filter2` should return an empty array, which satisfies the inferred relation. 

```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    Object[] events1 = filter2.getNewEvents();
    assertArrayEquals(new Object[] {}, events1);
}
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```

The `getNewEvents()` method is called on `filter2` and it returns an array containing the `jsonEventObject` of `mockEvent`. 

In this new input pair, we have created `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` objects similar to the original test case. We have also created empty `filter` and `filter2` objects. Since both `filter` and `filter2` are empty, the `getNewEvents()` method on `filter2` should return an empty array, which satisfies the inferred relation. 

```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    Object[] events1 = filter2.getNewEvents();
    assertArrayEquals(new Object[] {}, events1);
}
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```

The `getNewEvents()` method is called on `filter2` and it returns an array containing the `jsonEventObject` of `mockEvent`. 

In this new input pair, we have created `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` objects similar to the original test case. We have also created `filter` and `filter2` objects and added both `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` to `filter`. Since `filter` contains both events, the `getNewEvents()` method on `filter2` should return an array containing the `jsonEventObject` of `mockEvent`, which satisfies the inferred relation. 

```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    Object[] events1 = filter2.getNewEvents();
    assertArrayEquals(new Object[] { mockEvent.getJsonEventObject() }, events1);
}
```
