## Inferred Relation
Based on the given test case and the code under test, the inferred relation between the source input `v1` and the follow-up input `v2` is as follows:

- The `Version` class represents a version number in the format `major.minor.revision-build`.
- The `isLowerThan` method of the `Version` class compares two versions and returns `true` if the current version is lower than the provided version.
- The comparison is done by comparing the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of the two versions in order.
- If any of the numbers in the current version is lower than the corresponding number in the provided version, then the current version is considered lower.

## Explanation
To generate the follow-up input `v2` for the new source input `v1`, we need to find a version number that is greater than `v1` and satisfies the inferred relation.

For the new source input `v1 = "1.0-A1"`, we can generate the follow-up input `v2 = "1.1.0"`.

Explanation:
- The major version number of `v2` is greater than the major version number of `v1`.
- The minor version number of `v2` is greater than the minor version number of `v1`.
- The revision number of `v2` is greater than the revision number of `v1`.
- The build number of `v2` is not specified, so it is considered to be greater than any build number.

Therefore, the follow-up input pair is:
```java
String v1 = "1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.1.0";
```

This follow-up input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `v2` is greater than `v1` and the `isLowerThan` method should return `true` when comparing `v1` and `v2`.

## Complete Code
Here is the complete code for the new input pair:

```java
@Test
public void isLowerThanTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertTrue(a.isLowerThan(b));
}
```
