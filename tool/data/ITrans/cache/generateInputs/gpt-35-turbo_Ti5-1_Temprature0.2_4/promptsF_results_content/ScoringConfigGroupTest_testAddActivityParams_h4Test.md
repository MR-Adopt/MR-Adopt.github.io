## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input (`ap`) and the follow-up input (`type`) is that the `type` value should match the activity type of the `ap` object.

## Explanation:
The `addActivityParams` method adds the `params` object to the `ScoringConfigGroup` object. Before adding, it checks if there is already an existing `ActivityParams` object with the same activity type as the `params` object. If there is an existing object, it is removed and replaced with the new `params` object. The activity type is obtained using the `getActivityType()` method of the `params` object.

In the original test case, the `addActivityParams` method is called with the `ap` object, and then the `getActivityParams` method is called with the `type` value. The test asserts that the returned `ActivityParams` object should be equal to the `ap` object.

Based on this understanding, we can generate the follow-up inputs as follows:

## New input pair0:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type2");
String type = "type2";
```
Explanation: In this case, the `ap` object has an activity type of "type2", so the `type` value should also be "type2" to match the activity type.

## New input pair1:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type3");
String type = "type3";
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous case, the `ap` object has an activity type of "type3", so the `type` value should also be "type3" to match the activity type.

## New input pair2:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type4");
String type = "type4";
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the `ap` object has an activity type of "type4", so the `type` value should also be "type4" to match the activity type.

## New input pair3:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type5");
String type = "type5";
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the `ap` object has an activity type of "type5", so the `type` value should also be "type5" to match the activity type.

## New input pair4:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type6");
String type = "type6";
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the `ap` object has an activity type of "type6", so the `type` value should also be "type6" to match the activity type.

By ensuring that the `type` value matches the activity type of the `ap` object, we can generate follow-up inputs that adhere to the inferred relation and pass the assertions in the original test case.
