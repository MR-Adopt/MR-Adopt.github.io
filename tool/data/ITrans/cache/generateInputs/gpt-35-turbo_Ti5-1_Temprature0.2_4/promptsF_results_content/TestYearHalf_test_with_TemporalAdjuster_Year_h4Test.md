## Inferred Relation
The `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method creates an instance of `YearHalf` by taking a year and a half as input. The `with(Year)` method of `YearHalf` returns a new `YearHalf` instance with the year replaced by the specified year.

Based on the provided test case, it can be inferred that the `with(Year)` method replaces the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the year specified as the argument.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2000;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2005;
int year3 = 2005;
int half3 = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the specified year. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 2000 and half of 1. When the `with(Year)` method is called with the year 2005, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 2005, resulting in a new `YearHalf` instance with a year of 2005 and half of 1.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2021;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2022;
int year3 = 2022;
int half3 = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the specified year. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 2021 and half of 2. When the `with(Year)` method is called with the year 2022, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 2022, resulting in a new `YearHalf` instance with a year of 2022 and half of 2.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 1999;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2000;
int year3 = 2000;
int half3 = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the specified year. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 1999 and half of 1. When the `with(Year)` method is called with the year 2000, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 2000, resulting in a new `YearHalf` instance with a year of 2000 and half of 1.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2022;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2021;
int year3 = 2021;
int half3 = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the specified year. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 2022 and half of 1. When the `with(Year)` method is called with the year 2021, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 2021, resulting in a new `YearHalf` instance with a year of 2021 and half of 1.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 1900;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 1901;
int year3 = 1901;
int half3 = 2;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `with(Year)` method should replace the year of the `YearHalf` instance with the specified year. In this case, the original `YearHalf` instance has a year of 1900 and half of 2. When the `with(Year)` method is called with the year 1901, the year of the `YearHalf` instance should be replaced with 1901, resulting in a new `YearHalf` instance with a year of 1901 and half of 2.
