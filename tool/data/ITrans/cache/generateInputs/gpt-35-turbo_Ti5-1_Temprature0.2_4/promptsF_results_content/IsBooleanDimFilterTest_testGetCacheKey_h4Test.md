## New input pair0:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same field name, column type, and value as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `f3` is an `EqualityFilter` with field name "x", column type `STRING`, and value "hello". To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create a new source input `f3` with the same field name "x", column type `STRING`, and value "world". Then we create a follow-up input `f4` with the same field name "x", column type `STRING`, and value "world". Since both source and follow-up inputs have the same field name, column type, and value, they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same field name, column type, and value as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `f3` is an `EqualityFilter` with field name "x", column type `STRING`, and value "hello". To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create a new source input `f3` with a different field name "y", but with the same column type `STRING` and value "hello". Then we create a follow-up input `f4` with the same field name "y", column type `STRING`, and value "hello". Since both source and follow-up inputs have the same field name, column type, and value, they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, 123, null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.INTEGER, 123, null);
```
Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same field name, column type, and value as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `f3` is an `EqualityFilter` with field name "x", column type `STRING`, and value "hello". To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create a new source input `f3` with the same field name "x", but with a different column type `INTEGER` and value 123. Then we create a follow-up input `f4` with the same field name "x", column type `INTEGER`, and value 123. Since both source and follow-up inputs have the same field name, column type, and value, they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same field name, column type, and value as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `f3` is an `EqualityFilter` with field name "x", column type `STRING`, value "hello", and null dimension. To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create a new source input `f3` with the same field name "x", column type `STRING`, value "hello", and dimension "en". Then we create a follow-up input `f4` with the same field name "x", column type `STRING`, value "hello", and dimension "en". Since both source and follow-up inputs have the same field name, column type, value, and dimension, they satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, null, null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, null, null);
```
Inferred relation: The follow-up input should have the same field name, column type, and value as the source input.

Explanation: In the original test case, the source input `f3` is an `EqualityFilter` with field name "x", column type `STRING`, null value, and null dimension. To generate a follow-up input that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create a new source input `f3` with the same field name "x", column type `STRING`, null value, and null dimension. Then we create a follow-up input `f4` with the same field name "x", column type `STRING`, null value, and null dimension. Since both source and follow-up inputs have the same field name, column type, value, and dimension, they satisfy the inferred relation.
