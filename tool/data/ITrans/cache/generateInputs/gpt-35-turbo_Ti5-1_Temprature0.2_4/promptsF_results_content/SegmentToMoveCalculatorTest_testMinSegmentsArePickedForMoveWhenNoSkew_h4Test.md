## New input pair0:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
    String tier = "tier1";
    List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
    int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: 
- The `totalSegmentsInTier` is set to 0, which means there are no segments in the tier.
- The `tier` is set to "tier1".
- The `historicals` is created with two server holders.
- The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` is set to the maximum value of an integer.
- This input pair satisfies the inferred relation because when there are no segments in the tier, the minimum number of segments to move should be 0, and the number of segments to move should also be 0.
