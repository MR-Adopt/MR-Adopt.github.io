## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the `executor` and `support` objects is that the `support` object is created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` method as one of its constructor arguments.

## Explanation
In the original test case, an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object named `executor` is created with a thread pool id. Then, a `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object named `support` is created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` method as one of its constructor arguments. Finally, the test asserts that the `getThreadPoolId()` method of both objects returns the same value.

To generate a new follow-up input for a given new source input, we need to create a `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object using the `getThreadPoolId()` method of the corresponding `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object.

## New input pair 0:
```java
// New source input
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("new-test", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());

// New follow-up input
ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);

// Explanation
In this new input pair, a new `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object named `executor` is created with a different thread pool id. Then, a new `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object named `support` is created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` method as one of its constructor arguments. This ensures that the follow-up input adheres to the inferred relation and passes the assertions in the original test case.
