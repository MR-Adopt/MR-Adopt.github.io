## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up inputs `l2` and `b` is that `l2` should be greater than `l` and `b` should be `true`.

## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, `l` is set to `1000000000`. Since the inferred relation is that `l2` should be greater than `l`, we can set `l` to `0` and `l2` to `1` to satisfy the relation. Also, `b` should be `true` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE + 1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, `l` is set to `1000000000`. Since the inferred relation is that `l2` should be greater than `l`, we can set `l` to `Long.MAX_VALUE` and `l2` to `Long.MAX_VALUE + 1` to satisfy the relation. Also, `b` should be `true` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = 100000000;
    long l2 = 100000001;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, `l` is set to `1000000000`. Since the inferred relation is that `l2` should be greater than `l`, we can set `l` to `100000000` and `l2` to `100000001` to satisfy the relation. Also, `b` should be `true` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, `l` is set to `1000000000`. Since the inferred relation is that `l2` should be greater than `l`, we can set `l` to `-1` and `l2` to `0` to satisfy the relation. Also, `b` should be `true` to satisfy the relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = 500000000;
    long l2 = 500000001;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In the original test case, `l` is set to `1000000000`. Since the inferred relation is that `l2` should be greater than `l`, we can set `l` to `500000000` and `l2` to `500000001` to satisfy the relation. Also, `b` should be `true` to satisfy the relation.
