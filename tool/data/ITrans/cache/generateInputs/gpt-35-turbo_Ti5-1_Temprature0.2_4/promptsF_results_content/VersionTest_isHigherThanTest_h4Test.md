## Inferred Relation
The `isHigherThan` method in the `Version` class is used to compare two versions and determine if the first version is higher than the second version. The comparison is done based on the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of the versions.

The relation between the source input (`v1`) and the follow-up input (`v2`) is that the follow-up input should have a higher minor version number than the source input. This is because the `isHigherThan` method compares the minor version number to determine if one version is higher than the other.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`v2`) has a higher minor version number than the source input (`v1`). The `isHigherThan` method should return `false` for this input pair.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`v2`) has a higher minor version number than the source input (`v1`). The `isHigherThan` method should return `false` for this input pair.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.0.0.1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`v2`) has a higher minor version number than the source input (`v1`). The `isHigherThan` method should return `false` for this input pair.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.0.0.0.1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`v2`) has a higher minor version number than the source input (`v1`). The `isHigherThan` method should return `false` for this input pair.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.0.0.0.0.1";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`v2`) has a higher minor version number than the source input (`v1`). The `isHigherThan` method should return `false` for this input pair.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the source input `v1` is "1.0" and the follow-up input `v2` is "1.10". The inferred relation is that the follow-up input should have a higher minor version number than the source input. 

To generate the new input pairs, I kept the major version number the same as the source input and incremented the minor version number in the follow-up input. This ensures that the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and the `isHigherThan` method returns `false` for all the new input pairs.
