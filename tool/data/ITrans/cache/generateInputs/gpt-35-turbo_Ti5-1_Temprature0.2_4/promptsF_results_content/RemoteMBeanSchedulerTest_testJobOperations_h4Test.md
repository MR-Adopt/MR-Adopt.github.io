## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `job2Detail` and the follow-up input `job22` is that the `job22` is the key of the job in the `remoteScheduler` that corresponds to the `job2Detail` job detail.

## Explanation:
In the original test case, the `job2Detail` is added to the `remoteScheduler` using the `addJob` method. Then, the `getJobDetail` method is called on the `remoteScheduler` with the `job22` key to retrieve the job detail. The assertion checks if the retrieved job detail is equal to the `job2Detail`.

To generate the follow-up input, we need to create a new job detail and its corresponding key that satisfy the inferred relation. The key should be the same as the key used to add the job detail to the `remoteScheduler`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is the same as the key used to add the `job2Detail` to the `remoteScheduler`. Therefore, when the `getJobDetail` method is called with the `job22` key, it will retrieve the `job2Detail` job detail, and the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 1:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is the same as the key used to add the `job2Detail` to the `remoteScheduler`. Therefore, when the `getJobDetail` method is called with the `job22` key, it will retrieve the `job2Detail` job detail, and the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 2:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", "GROUP_KEY2")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", "GROUP_KEY2");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is the same as the key used to add the `job2Detail` to the `remoteScheduler`. Therefore, when the `getJobDetail` method is called with the `job22` key, it will retrieve the `job2Detail` job detail, and the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 3:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job4", "GROUP_KEY2")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job4", "GROUP_KEY2");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is the same as the key used to add the `job2Detail` to the `remoteScheduler`. Therefore, when the `getJobDetail` method is called with the `job22` key, it will retrieve the `job2Detail` job detail, and the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair 4:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job5", "GROUP_KEY3")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job5", "GROUP_KEY3");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is the same as the key used to add the `job2Detail` to the `remoteScheduler`. Therefore, when the `getJobDetail` method is called with the `job22` key, it will retrieve the `job2Detail` job detail, and the assertion in the original test case will pass.
