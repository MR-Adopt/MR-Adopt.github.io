In the given original test case, the method under test `YearHalf.from(TemporalAccessor temporal)` is used to obtain an instance of `YearHalf` from a temporal object. The method extracts the `YEAR` and `HALF_OF_YEAR` fields from the temporal object and creates a new `YearHalf` instance using the extracted values.

From the original test case, we can infer the following relation between the source input `date` and the follow-up inputs `year` and `expected`:
- The `year` value is obtained from the `YEAR` field of the `date` object.
- The `expected` value is calculated based on the `MONTH` field of the `date` object. It is calculated as `((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1`.

To generate the follow-up inputs for a new source input, we need to create a new `date` object and calculate the corresponding `year` and `expected` values based on the inferred relation.

# NEW SOURCE INPUTS
## New source input0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 15);
```

## New input pair0:
```java
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

In this case, the new source input `date` is set to `LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 15)`. 
Based on the inferred relation, the corresponding follow-up inputs are:
- `year` is set to `2022` (obtained from the `YEAR` field of `date`).
- `expected` is calculated as `((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1`, which is `2` in this case.

The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertions in the original test case pass.
