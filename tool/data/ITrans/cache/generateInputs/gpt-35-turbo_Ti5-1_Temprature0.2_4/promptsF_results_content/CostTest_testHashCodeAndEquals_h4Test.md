## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should also be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. Therefore, in this new input pair, `subject` and `other` have different values (`0` and `1` respectively), and their hash codes are different as well.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-10);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-11);
```

Explanation: Similar to the previous explanation, the inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should also be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. In this new input pair, `subject` and `other` have different values (`-10` and `-11` respectively), and their hash codes are different as well.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1);
```

Explanation: Again, the inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should also be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. In this new input pair, `subject` and `other` have different values (`Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1` respectively), and their hash codes are different as well.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should also be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. In this new input pair, `subject` and `other` have different values (`Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1` respectively), and their hash codes are different as well.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000001);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes should also be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`10` and `11` respectively), and their hash codes are different. In this new input pair, `subject` and `other` have different values (`1000000` and `1000001` respectively), and their hash codes are different as well.
