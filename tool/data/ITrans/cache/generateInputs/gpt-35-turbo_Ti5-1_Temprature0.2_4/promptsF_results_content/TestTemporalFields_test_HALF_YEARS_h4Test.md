## Inferred Relation:
The `addTo` method of the `YearQuarter` class adds the specified amount of quarters to the given `YearQuarter` object and returns the resulting `YearQuarter` object. The `addTo` method increments the year if necessary when adding quarters.

## Explanation:
Based on the inferred relation, the follow-up input should be constructed by adding the specified amount of quarters to the source input `YearQuarter` object. The resulting `YearQuarter` object should have the year incremented if necessary.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year1 = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = Year.MIN_VALUE + 1;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
The follow-up input is constructed by adding 1 quarter to the source input `YearQuarter` object (Year.MIN_VALUE, 1). Since the resulting quarter is greater than 4, the year is incremented by 1. The resulting `YearQuarter` object is (Year.MIN_VALUE + 1, 2), which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year1 = 2022;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
The follow-up input is constructed by adding 1 quarter to the source input `YearQuarter` object (2022, 3). The resulting `YearQuarter` object is (2022, 4), which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year1 = 2024;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2024;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
The follow-up input is constructed by adding 1 quarter to the source input `YearQuarter` object (2024, 2). The resulting `YearQuarter` object is (2024, 3), which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year1 = Year.MAX_VALUE;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = Year.MAX_VALUE;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
The follow-up input is constructed by adding 1 quarter to the source input `YearQuarter` object (Year.MAX_VALUE, 4). Since the resulting quarter is less than 1, the year is incremented by 1. The resulting `YearQuarter` object is (Year.MAX_VALUE + 1, 1), which satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year1 = 2019;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2019;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
The follow-up input is constructed by adding 1 quarter to the source input `YearQuarter` object (2019, 1). The resulting `YearQuarter` object is (2019, 2), which satisfies the inferred relation.
