## New input pair0:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("", 1, 1);
```

Inferred relation: The `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class only considers the `group` field when calculating the hash code.

Explanation: The new source input `requestKey1` has an empty string as the `group` field. The follow-up input `requestKey2` also has an empty string as the `group` field. Since the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` will have the same hash code, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey(null, 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey(null, 1, 1);
```

Inferred relation: The `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class only considers the `group` field when calculating the hash code.

Explanation: The new source input `requestKey1` has a `null` value as the `group` field. The follow-up input `requestKey2` also has a `null` value as the `group` field. Since the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` will have the same hash code, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("anotherGroup", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("anotherGroup", 1, 1);
```

Inferred relation: The `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class only considers the `group` field when calculating the hash code.

Explanation: The new source input `requestKey1` has a different value ("anotherGroup") as the `group` field. The follow-up input `requestKey2` also has the same value ("anotherGroup") as the `group` field. Since the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` will have the same hash code, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 10, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 10, 1);
```

Inferred relation: The `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class only considers the `group` field when calculating the hash code.

Explanation: The new source input `requestKey1` has the same value ("group") as the `group` field and different values for the other fields. The follow-up input `requestKey2` also has the same value ("group") as the `group` field and different values for the other fields. Since the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` will have the same hash code, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 10);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 1, 10);
```

Inferred relation: The `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class only considers the `group` field when calculating the hash code.

Explanation: The new source input `requestKey1` has the same value ("group") as the `group` field and different values for the other fields. The follow-up input `requestKey2` also has the same value ("group") as the `group` field and different values for the other fields. Since the `hashCode()` method only considers the `group` field, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` will have the same hash code, satisfying the inferred relation.
