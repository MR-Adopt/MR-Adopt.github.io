## New input pair0:
```java
Closeable closeable = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case. The `closeable` object is created as a new `FileInputStream` and then passed to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor to create a new `ResourceHolder` object. The `holder2` object is then assigned the value of `closeable`. This ensures that the `holder2` object holds a reference to the same `closeable` resource.

## New input pair1:
```java
Closeable closeable = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

This new input pair also satisfies the inferred relation. The `closeable` object is created as a new `Socket` and then passed to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor to create a new `ResourceHolder` object. The `holder2` object is then assigned the value of `closeable`. This ensures that the `holder2` object holds a reference to the same `closeable` resource.

## New input pair2:
```java
Closeable closeable = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

This new input pair follows the same pattern as the original test case. The `closeable` object is created as a new `ByteArrayOutputStream` and then passed to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor to create a new `ResourceHolder` object. The `holder2` object is then assigned the value of `closeable`. This ensures that the `holder2` object holds a reference to the same `closeable` resource.

## New input pair3:
```java
Closeable closeable = new PipedInputStream();
ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation. The `closeable` object is created as a new `PipedInputStream` and then passed to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor to create a new `ResourceHolder` object. The `holder2` object is then assigned the value of `closeable`. This ensures that the `holder2` object holds a reference to the same `closeable` resource.

## New input pair4:
```java
Closeable closeable = new FilterInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
    @Override
    public void close() throws IOException {
        super.close();
    }
};
ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

This new input pair also follows the same pattern as the original test case. The `closeable` object is created as a new `FilterInputStream` with a `FileInputStream` as its input stream. The `close()` method is overridden to call the `super.close()` method. The `closeable` object is then passed to the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor to create a new `ResourceHolder` object. The `holder2` object is then assigned the value of `closeable`. This ensures that the `holder2` object holds a reference to the same `closeable` resource.
