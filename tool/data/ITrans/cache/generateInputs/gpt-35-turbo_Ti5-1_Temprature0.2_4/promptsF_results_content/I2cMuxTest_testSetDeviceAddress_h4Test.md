## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `i2cMux`, `deviceAddress` and the follow-up input `i2cMux2` is that when `i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress)` is called, the `deviceAddress` value is set in `i2cMux` and can be retrieved using `i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress()`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x70";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case. The `deviceAddress` value is set in `i2cMux` using `i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress)`, and then it is retrieved from `i2cMux2` using `i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress()`. The `deviceAddress` value is "0x70" in both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2`, so the assertion `assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress())` will pass.

## New input pair 1:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x71";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair also satisfies the inferred relation. The `deviceAddress` value is set in `i2cMux` using `i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress)`, and then it is retrieved from `i2cMux2` using `i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress()`. The `deviceAddress` value is "0x71" in both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2`, so the assertion `assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress())` will pass.

## New input pair 2:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x72";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair also satisfies the inferred relation. The `deviceAddress` value is set in `i2cMux` using `i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress)`, and then it is retrieved from `i2cMux2` using `i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress()`. The `deviceAddress` value is "0x72" in both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2`, so the assertion `assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress())` will pass.

## New input pair 3:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x73";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair also satisfies the inferred relation. The `deviceAddress` value is set in `i2cMux` using `i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress)`, and then it is retrieved from `i2cMux2` using `i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress()`. The `deviceAddress` value is "0x73" in both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2`, so the assertion `assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress())` will pass.

## New input pair 4:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x74";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
```
This new input pair also satisfies the inferred relation. The `deviceAddress` value is set in `i2cMux` using `i2cMux.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress)`, and then it is retrieved from `i2cMux2` using `i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress()`. The `deviceAddress` value is "0x74" in both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2`, so the assertion `assertEquals(deviceAddress, i2cMux2.getDeviceAddress())` will pass.
