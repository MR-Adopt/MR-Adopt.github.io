## New input pair0:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "testModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "testModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```

Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that when a symptom is addressed from a module using the `addressSource` method, the `onSet` method can be called to update the symptom's data structure with the symptom being onset from the same module. In this case, the source input `symptom` and `module` are used to address the symptom, and then the follow-up input `symptom2` and `module2` are used to update the symptom's data structure. Both the source input and follow-up input use the same module name "testModule", which satisfies the inferred relation.
