## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) and the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) is that `year3` should be equal to `year1` and `half3` should be equal to `half2`.

## New input pair0:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs are `year1 = 2007`, `half1 = 1`, and `half2 = 1`. According to the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs should be `year3 = 2007` and `half3 = 1`. These values satisfy the relation and ensure that the assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year1 = 2022;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2022;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs are `year1 = 2022`, `half1 = 1`, and `half2 = 2`. According to the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs should be `year3 = 2022` and `half3 = 2`. These values satisfy the relation and ensure that the assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year1 = 1999;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 1999;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs are `year1 = 1999`, `half1 = 2`, and `half2 = 2`. According to the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs should be `year3 = 1999` and `half3 = 2`. These values satisfy the relation and ensure that the assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year1 = 2025;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2025;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs are `year1 = 2025`, `half1 = 1`, and `half2 = 1`. According to the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs should be `year3 = 2025` and `half3 = 1`. These values satisfy the relation and ensure that the assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year1 = 1990;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 1990;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs are `year1 = 1990`, `half1 = 2`, and `half2 = 1`. According to the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs should be `year3 = 1990` and `half3 = 1`. These values satisfy the relation and ensure that the assertion in the original test case passes.
