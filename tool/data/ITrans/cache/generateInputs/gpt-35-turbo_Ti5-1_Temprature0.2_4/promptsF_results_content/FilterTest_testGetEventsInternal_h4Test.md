## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list.

Explanation: In the original test case, the `filter` object is created and two `mockEvent` objects are added to it. Then, a new `filter2` object is created and the same `mockEvent` objects are added to it. Since the `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list, we can create a new `filter2` object with the same events added to it and it will satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list.

Explanation: In this new input pair, an additional `mockEvent1` object is added to the `filter` object. Since the `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list, we can create a new `filter2` object with the same events added to it and it will satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(null);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(null);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list.

Explanation: In this new input pair, a `null` event is added to the `filter` object. Since the `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list, we can create a new `filter2` object with the same events added to it and it will satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(new FilterEventMock());
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list.

Explanation: In this new input pair, a new `FilterEventMock` object is added to the `filter` object. Since the `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list, we can create a new `filter2` object with the same events added to it and it will satisfy the inferred relation.
