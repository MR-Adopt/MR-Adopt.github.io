## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year` and `half`) and the follow-up input (`text`) is that the `text` is constructed by concatenating the `year` and `half` values with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is constructed by concatenating the `year` (2020) and `half` (1) values with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2000-H2";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is constructed by concatenating the `year` (2000) and `half` (2) values with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1999-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is constructed by concatenating the `year` (1999) and `half` (1) values with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year = 2025;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2025-H2";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is constructed by concatenating the `year` (2025) and `half` (2) values with a hyphen in between.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year = 2030;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2030-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is constructed by concatenating the `year` (2030) and `half` (1) values with a hyphen in between.

The follow-up inputs are constructed by following the same pattern as the original test case, where the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` and `half` values with a hyphen in between. This ensures that the follow-up inputs satisfy the inferred relation and pass the assertions in the original test case.
