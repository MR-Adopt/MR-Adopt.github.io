## Inferred Relation
The `valueOf` method takes a version string as input and splits it into major, minor, revision, and build components. The major, minor, and revision components are split using a dot as the delimiter, while the build component is split using a hyphen as the delimiter. The major, minor, revision, and build components are then used to create a new `Version` object.

Based on the given test case, it can be inferred that the `isEqual` method of the `Version` class checks if two `Version` objects have the same major, minor, and revision components. If they do, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0";
String v2 = "1.1.0";
```
In this new input pair, both `v1` and `v2` have the same major, minor, and revision components. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String v1 = "2.0";
String v2 = "2.0";
```
In this new input pair, both `v1` and `v2` have the same major component. Since the minor and revision components are not provided, they are considered null. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String v1 = "1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
In this new input pair, both `v1` and `v2` have the same major component and the same build component. Since the minor and revision components are not provided, they are considered null. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
In this new input pair, both `v1` and `v2` have the same major, minor, and revision components. The build components are not provided, so they are considered null. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String v1 = "1.0-A1-B2";
String v2 = "1.0-A1-B2";
```
In this new input pair, both `v1` and `v2` have the same major component and the same build component. Since the minor and revision components are not provided, they are considered null. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

## Explanation
The new input pairs satisfy the inferred relation because they have the same major, minor, and revision components (if provided) or the same major and build components (if minor and revision components are not provided). This ensures that the `isEqual` method will return `true` for these input pairs.
