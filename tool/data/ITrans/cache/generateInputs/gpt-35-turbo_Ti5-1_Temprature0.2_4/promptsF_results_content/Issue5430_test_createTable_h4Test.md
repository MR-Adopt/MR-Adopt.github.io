## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint)";
```
The inferred relation is that the method `normalizeSql` removes unnecessary spaces and formats the SQL string to have consistent spacing and parentheses. In this case, the original SQL string has spaces before and after the parentheses, which are removed in the normalized SQL string. The follow-up input removes the unnecessary spaces to match the normalized format.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe'";
```
The inferred relation is the same as in the previous case. The method `normalizeSql` removes unnecessary spaces and formats the SQL string to have consistent spacing and parentheses. In this case, the original SQL string has spaces before and after the parentheses, which are removed in the normalized SQL string. The follow-up input removes the unnecessary spaces to match the normalized format.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation is the same as in the previous cases. The method `normalizeSql` removes unnecessary spaces and formats the SQL string to have consistent spacing and parentheses. In this case, the original SQL string has spaces before and after the parentheses, which are removed in the normalized SQL string. The follow-up input removes the unnecessary spaces to match the normalized format.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```
The inferred relation is the same as in the previous cases. The method `normalizeSql` removes unnecessary spaces and formats the SQL string to have consistent spacing and parentheses. In this case, the original SQL string has spaces before and after the parentheses, which are removed in the normalized SQL string. The follow-up input removes the unnecessary spaces to match the normalized format.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) COMMENT 'This is a table'";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) COMMENT 'This is a table'";
```
The inferred relation is the same as in the previous cases. The method `normalizeSql` removes unnecessary spaces and formats the SQL string to have consistent spacing and parentheses. In this case, the original SQL string has spaces before and after the parentheses, which are removed in the normalized SQL string. The follow-up input removes the unnecessary spaces to match the normalized format. Additionally, the follow-up input also includes the comment part, which is preserved in the normalized format.
