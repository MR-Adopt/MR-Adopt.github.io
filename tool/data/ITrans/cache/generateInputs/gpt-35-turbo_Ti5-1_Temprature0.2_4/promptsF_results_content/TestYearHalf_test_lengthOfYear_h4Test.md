## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 0;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(0, 1);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the follow-up input can be generated by calling the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `year` and `half` values as the source input. In this case, the source input has `year` as 0 and `half` as `Half.H1`. Therefore, the follow-up input is generated by calling `YearHalf.of(0, 1)`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2022, 2);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the follow-up input can be generated by calling the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `year` and `half` values as the source input. In this case, the source input has `year` as 2022 and `half` as `Half.H2`. Therefore, the follow-up input is generated by calling `YearHalf.of(2022, 2)`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(9999, 1);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the follow-up input can be generated by calling the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `year` and `half` values as the source input. In this case, the source input has `year` as 9999 and `half` as `Half.H1`. Therefore, the follow-up input is generated by calling `YearHalf.of(9999, 1)`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    Half half = Half.H2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(2000, 2);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the follow-up input can be generated by calling the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `year` and `half` values as the source input. In this case, the source input has `year` as 2000 and `half` as `Half.H2`. Therefore, the follow-up input is generated by calling `YearHalf.of(2000, 2)`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1582;
    Half half = Half.H1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(1582, 1);
```
Explanation: 
The inferred relation is that the follow-up input can be generated by calling the `YearHalf.of()` method with the same `year` and `half` values as the source input. In this case, the source input has `year` as 1582 and `half` as `Half.H1`. Therefore, the follow-up input is generated by calling `YearHalf.of(1582, 1)`. This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and will pass the assertions in the original test case.
