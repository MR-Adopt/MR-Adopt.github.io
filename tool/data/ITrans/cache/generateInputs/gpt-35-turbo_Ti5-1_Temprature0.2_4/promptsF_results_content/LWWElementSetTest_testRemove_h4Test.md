## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `element` and the follow-up input `element2` is that they have the same key, value, and bias.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `remove` method is called with `element2` as the input, which has the same key, value, and bias as `element`. The `remove` method checks if the element exists in the set by calling the `lookup` method. Since `element2` has the same key, value, and bias as `element`, the `lookup` method returns true and the element is removed from the set.

To generate the follow-up input `element2` for each new source input, we need to ensure that `element2` has the same key, value, and bias as `element`. 

## New input pair 0:
```java
Element element = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
Element element2 = new Element("key2", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key2"), value (2), and bias as specified in the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
Element element = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
Element element2 = new Element("key1", 2, bias);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key1"), value (2), and bias as specified in the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
Element element = new Element("key1", 1, null);
Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, null);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key1"), value (1), and bias (null) as specified in the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
Element element = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
Element element2 = new Element("key2", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key2"), value (1), and bias as specified in the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
Element element = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
Element element2 = new Element("key1", 1, bias);
```
Explanation: In this case, both `element` and `element2` have the same key ("key1"), value (1), and bias as specified in the inferred relation.
