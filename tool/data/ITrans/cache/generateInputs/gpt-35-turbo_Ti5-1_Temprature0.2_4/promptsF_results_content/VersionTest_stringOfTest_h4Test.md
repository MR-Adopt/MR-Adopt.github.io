# Inferred Relation
The `valueOf` method takes a version string as input and constructs a `Version` object. The `stringOf` method takes a `Version` object as input and returns its string representation. The inferred relation between the source input `v` and the follow-up input `version1` is that `version1` is the `Version` object constructed from the `v` string.

# New input pair 0:
```java
String v = "2.0.0";
Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `version1` is the `Version` object constructed from the source input `v` string. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair 1:
```java
String v = "1.1.0";
Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `version1` is the `Version` object constructed from the source input `v` string. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair 2:
```java
String v = "1.0.1";
Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `version1` is the `Version` object constructed from the source input `v` string. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair 3:
```java
String v = "1.0-A1";
Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `version1` is the `Version` object constructed from the source input `v` string. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

# New input pair 4:
```java
String v = "1.1.0-A1";
Version version1 = Version.valueOf(v);
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `version1` is the `Version` object constructed from the source input `v` string. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
