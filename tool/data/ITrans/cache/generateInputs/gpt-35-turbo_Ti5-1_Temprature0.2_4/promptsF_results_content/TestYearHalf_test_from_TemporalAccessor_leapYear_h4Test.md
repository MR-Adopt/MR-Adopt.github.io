# Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`date`) and the follow-up inputs (`year` and `expected`) is as follows:
- The `year` is obtained by extracting the year value from the `date`.
- The `expected` is calculated by dividing the month value of the `date` minus 1 by 6 and adding 1.

# New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because:
- The `year` is set to the year value extracted from the `date`, which is 2022.
- The `expected` is calculated by dividing the month value of the `date` minus 1 by 6 and adding 1. In this case, the month value is 7, so the calculation is ((7 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 2.

The new input pair ensures that the assertions in the original test case pass.
