## New input pair0:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 1;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, n, o);
    int position2 = 1;
```

Explanation: 
- In the original test case, `association` is created with atoms `c` and `o`, and `n` is set at position 0 using `setAtomAt` method. 
- In the new input pair, `association2` is created with atoms `c`, `n`, and `o`, and `n` is set at position 1 using `setAtomAt` method. 
- The inferred relation is that when an atom is set at a position in `association`, the same atom should be set at the corresponding position in `association2`. 
- This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it sets the same atom `n` at the same position 1 in `association2` as it was set in `association`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 2;
    Association association2 = new Association(c, o, n);
    int position2 = 2;
```

Explanation: 
- In the original test case, `association` is created with atoms `c` and `o`, and `n` is set at position 0 using `setAtomAt` method. 
- In the new input pair, `association2` is created with atoms `c`, `o`, and `n`, and `n` is set at position 2 using `setAtomAt` method. 
- The inferred relation is that when an atom is set at a position in `association`, the same atom should be set at the corresponding position in `association2`. 
- This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it sets the same atom `n` at the same position 2 in `association2` as it was set in `association`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = -1;
    Association association2 = new Association(n, o);
    int position2 = -1;
```

Explanation: 
- In the original test case, `association` is created with atoms `c` and `o`, and `n` is set at position 0 using `setAtomAt` method. 
- In the new input pair, `association2` is created with atoms `n` and `o`, and `n` is set at position -1 using `setAtomAt` method. 
- The inferred relation is that when an atom is set at a position in `association`, the same atom should be set at the corresponding position in `association2`. 
- This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation as it sets the same atom `n` at the same position -1 in `association2` as it was set in `association`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Atom c = new Atom("C");
    Atom o = new Atom("O");
    Atom n = new Atom("N");
    Association association = new Association(c, o);
    int position = 0;
    association.setAtomAt(n, position);
    Association association2 = new Association(n, o);
    int position2 = 0;
```

- In the original test case, `association` is created with atoms `c` and `o`, and `n` is set at position 0 using `setAtomAt` method.
