## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `year2`) and the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) is that the `year3` and `half3` values should be the same as the `year1` and `half1` values respectively.

## Explanation:
The `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method creates a new instance of `YearHalf` by checking the validity of the `year` and `half` values and returning a new `YearHalf` object. In the original test case, the `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` method is used to create a `YearHalf` object with the same `year` and `half` values as the `YearHalf` object created using `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)`. Then, the `withYear(year2)` method is called on the `YearHalf` object created using `YearHalf.of(year1, half1)` to change the `year` value to `year2`. The `assertEquals` statement checks if the `YearHalf` object created using `YearHalf.of(year1, half1).withYear(year2)` is equal to the `YearHalf` object created using `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`.

To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) should have the same values as the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`).

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2000;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2005;
int year3 = 2000;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`) are `2000` and `1` respectively. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are set to the same values as the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`).

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2021;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2022;
int year3 = 2021;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`) are `2021` and `1` respectively. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are set to the same values as the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`).

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 1995;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2000;
int year3 = 1995;
int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`) are `1995` and `2` respectively. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are set to the same values as the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`).

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2022;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2023;
int year3 = 2022;
int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`) are `2022` and `2` respectively. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are set to the same values as the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`).

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 2005;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2010;
int year3 = 2005;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`) are `2005` and `1` respectively. To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are set to the same values as the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`).
