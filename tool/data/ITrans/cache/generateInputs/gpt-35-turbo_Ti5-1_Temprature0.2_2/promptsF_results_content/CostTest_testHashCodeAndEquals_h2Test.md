## New input pair0:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(0);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes will be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`subject` has a value of 10 and `other` has a value of 11), so their hash codes are expected to be different. In the new input pair, `subject` has a value of 0 and `other` has a value of 1, which are different values. Therefore, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes will be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`subject` has a value of 10 and `other` has a value of 11), so their hash codes are expected to be different. In the new input pair, `subject` has the maximum possible value for an `int` and `other` has a value that is 1 less than the maximum value. These values are different, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(-10);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(-11);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes will be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`subject` has a value of 10 and `other` has a value of 11), so their hash codes are expected to be different. In the new input pair, `subject` has a negative value of -10 and `other` has a negative value of -11. These values are different, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000000);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(1000001);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes will be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`subject` has a value of 10 and `other` has a value of 11), so their hash codes are expected to be different. In the new input pair, `subject` has a value of 1000000 and `other` has a value of 1000001. These values are different, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Cost subject = Cost.costOfSeconds(1);
    Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(2);
```
Explanation: The inferred relation is that if two `Cost` objects have different values, their hash codes will be different. In the original test case, `subject` and `other` have different values (`subject` has a value of 10 and `other` has a value of 11), so their hash codes are expected to be different. In the new input pair, `subject` has a value of 1 and `other` has a value of 2. These values are different, so the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
