## Inferred Relation:
The method `YearHalf.of(year, half)` creates a new instance of `YearHalf` using the given `year` and `half` values. The `YearHalf` class represents a specific year and half-of-year. The `with(Year)` method of `YearHalf` returns a new instance of `YearHalf` with the year replaced by the specified `Year` value.

Based on the given test case, it can be inferred that the `with(Year)` method replaces the year value of the `YearHalf` instance with the year value of the specified `Year` instance.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year1 = 2000;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2005;
    int year3 = 2005;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```

Explanation:
In the original test case, the `YearHalf` instance is created with `year1` and `half1` values. Then, the `with(Year)` method is called with `Year.of(year2)` as the argument. The expected result is `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)`. 

To generate a new input pair, we can choose `year1` and `half1` as the source input values. Then, we can set `year2` as the same value as `year1` and `year3` as `year2`. Finally, we set `half3` as the same value as `half1`. This ensures that the follow-up input `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` will be equal to the expected result.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year1 = 2021;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int year3 = 2022;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```

Explanation:
Similar to the previous new input pair, we can choose `year1` and `half1` as the source input values. Then, we set `year2` as the same value as `year1` and `year3` as `year2`. Finally, we set `half3` as the same value as `half1`. This ensures that the follow-up input `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` will be equal to the expected result.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year1 = 1999;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2000;
    int year3 = 2000;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```

Explanation:
Again, we can choose `year1` and `half1` as the source input values. Then, we set `year2` as the same value as `year1` and `year3` as `year2`. Finally, we set `half3` as the same value as `half1`. This ensures that the follow-up input `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` will be equal to the expected result.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year1 = 2022;
    int half1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int year3 = 2023;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```

Explanation:
Similar to the previous new input pairs, we can choose `year1` and `half1` as the source input values. Then, we set `year2` as the same value as `year1` and `year3` as `year2`. Finally, we set `half3` as the same value as `half1`. This ensures that the follow-up input `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` will be equal to the expected result.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year1 = 2005;
    int half1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2006;
    int year3 = 2006;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Follow-up input:
```java
    YearHalf.of(year3, half3)
```

Explanation:
Again, we can choose `year1` and `half1` as the source input values. Then, we set `year2` as the same value as `year1` and `year3` as `year2`. Finally, we set `half3` as the same value as `half1`. This ensures that the follow-up input `YearHalf.of(year3, half3)` will be equal to the expected result.
