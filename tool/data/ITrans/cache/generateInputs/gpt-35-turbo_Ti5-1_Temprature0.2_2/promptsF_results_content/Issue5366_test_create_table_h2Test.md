## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 3);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is the same as the source input. The `normalizeSql` method does not modify the input SQL, so the original SQL and the normalized SQL will be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 0);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4 , REMAINDER 0);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is the same as the source input. The `normalizeSql` method does not modify the input SQL, so the original SQL and the normalized SQL will be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 2, REMAINDER 1);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 2 , REMAINDER 1);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is the same as the source input. The `normalizeSql` method does not modify the input SQL, so the original SQL and the normalized SQL will be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8, REMAINDER 7);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 8 , REMAINDER 7);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is the same as the source input. The `normalizeSql` method does not modify the input SQL, so the original SQL and the normalized SQL will be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 1, REMAINDER 0);";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE orders_p4 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 1 , REMAINDER 0);";
```

In this case, the follow-up input is the same as the source input. The `normalizeSql` method does not modify the input SQL, so the original SQL and the normalized SQL will be the same.

The `normalizeSql` method only performs string replacements to remove unnecessary spaces, tabs, and convert single quotes to double quotes. It does not modify the structure or content of the SQL statement. Therefore, any valid SQL statement will remain the same after normalization.
