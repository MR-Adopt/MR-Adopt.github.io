# Inferred Relation
The method `valueOf` in the `Version` class takes a string representation of a version number and constructs a `Version` object. The `stringOf` method in the `Version` class returns the string representation of a `Version` object.

Based on the original test case, it can be inferred that the `valueOf` method constructs a `Version` object from a string representation of a version number, and the `stringOf` method returns the string representation of a `Version` object.

# New input pair 0:
```java
String v = "2.0.0";
Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it constructs a `Version` object from the string representation "2.0.0" using the `valueOf` method. The `valueOf` method should be able to handle any valid version number string, so this input pair should pass the assertions in the original test case.

# New input pair 1:
```java
String v = "1.1.0";
Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it constructs a `Version` object from the string representation "1.1.0" using the `valueOf` method. The `valueOf` method should be able to handle any valid version number string, so this input pair should pass the assertions in the original test case.

# New input pair 2:
```java
String v = "1.0.1";
Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it constructs a `Version` object from the string representation "1.0.1" using the `valueOf` method. The `valueOf` method should be able to handle any valid version number string, so this input pair should pass the assertions in the original test case.

# New input pair 3:
```java
String v = "1.0-A1";
Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it constructs a `Version` object from the string representation "1.0-A1" using the `valueOf` method. The `valueOf` method should be able to handle any valid version number string, so this input pair should pass the assertions in the original test case.

# New input pair 4:
```java
String v = "1.1.0-A1";
Version version = Version.valueOf(v);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it constructs a `Version` object from the string representation "1.1.0-A1" using the `valueOf` method. The `valueOf` method should be able to handle any valid version number string, so this input pair should pass the assertions in the original test case.
