## New input pair0:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
In the original test case, the `hashCode()` method is called on both `subject` and `other3` objects of the `FieldDefinition` class. The `hashCode()` method returns the hash code value of the object based on its `name`, `type`, and `deprecated` properties. 

In the original test case, `subject` is created with name "foo" and type `TokenType.STRING`. To create a follow-up input `other3` that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create it with the same name and type as `subject`, but with the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method.

In the new input pair0, `subject` is created with an empty name and type `TokenType.STRING`. The follow-up input `other3` is created with the same empty name and type `TokenType.STRING`, and the `deprecated` property is set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method. This ensures that the `hashCode()` values of `subject` and `other3` are different, satisfying the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.INT);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.INT).deprecate();
```
In the original test case, `subject` is created with name "foo" and type `TokenType.STRING`. To create a follow-up input `other3` that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create it with the same name and type as `subject`, but with the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method.

In the new input pair1, `subject` is created with name "foo" and type `TokenType.INT`. The follow-up input `other3` is created with the same name "foo" and type `TokenType.INT`, and the `deprecated` property is set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method. This ensures that the `hashCode()` values of `subject` and `other3` are different, satisfying the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition(null, TokenType.STRING);
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition(null, TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
In the original test case, `subject` is created with a `null` name and type `TokenType.STRING`. To create a follow-up input `other3` that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create it with the same `null` name and type as `subject`, but with the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method.

In the new input pair2, `subject` is created with a `null` name and type `TokenType.STRING`. The follow-up input `other3` is created with the same `null` name and type `TokenType.STRING`, and the `deprecated` property is set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method. This ensures that the `hashCode()` values of `subject` and `other3` are different, satisfying the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING);
```
In the original test case, `subject` is created with name "foo", type `TokenType.STRING`, and the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method. To create a follow-up input `other3` that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create it with the same name and type as `subject`, but with the `deprecated` property set to `false`.

In the new input pair3, `subject` is created with name "foo", type `TokenType.STRING`, and the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method. The follow-up input `other3` is created with the same name "foo", type `TokenType.STRING`, and the `deprecated` property set to `false`. This ensures that the `hashCode()` values of `subject` and `other3` are different, satisfying the assertion in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    FieldDefinition subject = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate().deprecate();
    FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition("foo", TokenType.STRING).deprecate();
```
In the original test case, `subject` is created with name "foo", type `TokenType.STRING`, and the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method twice. To create a follow-up input `other3` that satisfies the inferred relation, we can create it with the same name and type as `subject`, but with the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method only once.

In the new input pair4, `subject` is created with name "foo", type `TokenType.STRING`, and the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method twice. The follow-up input `other3` is created with the same name "foo", type `TokenType.STRING`, and the `deprecated` property set to `true` using the `deprecate()` method only once. This ensures that the `hashCode()` values of `subject` and `other3` are different, satisfying the assertion in the original test case.
