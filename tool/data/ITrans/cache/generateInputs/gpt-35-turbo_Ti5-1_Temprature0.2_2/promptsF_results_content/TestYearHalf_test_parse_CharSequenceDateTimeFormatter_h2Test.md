## New input pair0:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2020";
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: The follow-up input pair is generated by changing the values of `text`, `year`, and `half` in the original test case. The new `text` is "H2 2020", which represents the second half of the year 2020. The new `year` is 2020, and the new `half` is 2. These values satisfy the inferred relation that the `text` should contain the half of the year and the year, and the `year` and `half` should match the parsed values from the `text`.

## New input pair1:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H1 1999";
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: The follow-up input pair is generated by changing the values of `text`, `year`, and `half` in the original test case. The new `text` is "H1 1999", which represents the first half of the year 1999. The new `year` is 1999, and the new `half` is 1. These values satisfy the inferred relation that the `text` should contain the half of the year and the year, and the `year` and `half` should match the parsed values from the `text`.

## New input pair2:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2022";
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: The follow-up input pair is generated by changing the values of `text`, `year`, and `half` in the original test case. The new `text` is "H2 2022", which represents the second half of the year 2022. The new `year` is 2022, and the new `half` is 2. These values satisfy the inferred relation that the `text` should contain the half of the year and the year, and the `year` and `half` should match the parsed values from the `text`.

## New input pair3:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H1 2005";
    int year = 2005;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: The follow-up input pair is generated by changing the values of `text`, `year`, and `half` in the original test case. The new `text` is "H1 2005", which represents the first half of the year 2005. The new `year` is 2005, and the new `half` is 1. These values satisfy the inferred relation that the `text` should contain the half of the year and the year, and the `year` and `half` should match the parsed values from the `text`.

## New input pair4:
```java
    DateTimeFormatter f = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendLiteral('H').appendValue(HALF_OF_YEAR, 1).appendLiteral(' ').appendValue(YEAR).toFormatter();
    CharSequence text = "H2 2030";
    int year = 2030;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: The follow-up input pair is generated by changing the values of `text`, `year`, and `half` in the original test case. The new `text` is "H2 2030", which represents the second half of the year 2030. The new `year` is 2030, and the new `half` is 2. These values satisfy the inferred relation that the `text` should contain the half of the year and the year, and the `year` and `half` should match the parsed values from the `text`.
