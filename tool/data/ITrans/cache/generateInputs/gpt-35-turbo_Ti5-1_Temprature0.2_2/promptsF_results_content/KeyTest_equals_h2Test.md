## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `type1` and the follow-up input `type2` is that they should be of the same class type.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `equals()` method is called on two instances of `Key` objects created using the `Key.get()` method. The `Key.get()` method takes a `Class` object as a parameter and returns a `Key` object.

In the new input pairs, we need to ensure that `type1` and `type2` are of the same class type to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair 0:
```java
Class<?> type1 = Integer.class;
Class<?> type2 = Integer.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, both `type1` and `type2` are of the same class type `Integer`, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
Class<?> type1 = List.class;
Class<?> type2 = List.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, both `type1` and `type2` are of the same class type `List`, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
Class<?> type1 = Object.class;
Class<?> type2 = Object.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, both `type1` and `type2` are of the same class type `Object`, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
Class<?> type1 = Double.class;
Class<?> type2 = Double.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, both `type1` and `type2` are of the same class type `Double`, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
Class<?> type1 = Map.class;
Class<?> type2 = Map.class;
```
Explanation: In this case, both `type1` and `type2` are of the same class type `Map`, satisfying the inferred relation.
