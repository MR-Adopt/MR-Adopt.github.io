## New input pair0:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(1, 1);
original.set(0, 0, 0);
MatrixStore<Double> shifted2 = DiscreteFourierTransform.shift(original);
```
Explanation: 
- The original source input is a 1x1 matrix with a single element set to 0.
- The `shift` method is called on the original matrix to obtain the shifted matrix.
- Since the original matrix has only one element, there is no need to perform any shifting. The shifted matrix will be the same as the original matrix.
- The follow-up input is the shifted matrix itself.

## New input pair1:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(3, 3);
for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        original.set(i, j, i + j);
    }
}
MatrixStore<Double> shifted2 = DiscreteFourierTransform.shift(original);
```
Explanation: 
- The original source input is a 3x3 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices.
- The `shift` method is called on the original matrix to obtain the shifted matrix.
- The shifted matrix will have the first half of the rows and columns as the complex conjugates of the second half, with the zero-frequency term in the middle.
- The follow-up input is the shifted matrix.

## New input pair2:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(2, 4);
for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        original.set(i, j, i + j);
    }
}
MatrixStore<Double> shifted2 = DiscreteFourierTransform.shift(original);
```
Explanation: 
- The original source input is a 2x4 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices.
- The `shift` method is called on the original matrix to obtain the shifted matrix.
- The shifted matrix will have the first half of the rows and columns as the complex conjugates of the second half, with the zero-frequency term in the middle.
- The follow-up input is the shifted matrix.

## New input pair3:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(4, 2);
for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        original.set(i, j, i + j);
    }
}
MatrixStore<Double> shifted2 = DiscreteFourierTransform.shift(original);
```
Explanation: 
- The original source input is a 4x2 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices.
- The `shift` method is called on the original matrix to obtain the shifted matrix.
- The shifted matrix will have the first half of the rows and columns as the complex conjugates of the second half, with the zero-frequency term in the middle.
- The follow-up input is the shifted matrix.

## New input pair4:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(0, 0);
MatrixStore<Double> shifted2 = DiscreteFourierTransform.shift(original);
```
Explanation: 
- The original source input is an empty matrix with no elements.
- The `shift` method is called on the original matrix to obtain the shifted matrix.
- Since the original matrix is empty, the shifted matrix will also be empty.
- The follow-up input is the shifted matrix itself.
