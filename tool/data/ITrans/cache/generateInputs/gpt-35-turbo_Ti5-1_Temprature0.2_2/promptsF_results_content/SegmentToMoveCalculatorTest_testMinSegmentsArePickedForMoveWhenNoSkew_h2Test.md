## Inferred Relation
Based on the given test case and the code under test, we can infer the following relation between the source inputs and the follow-up inputs:

1. The `totalSegmentsInTier` value is used to calculate the minimum number of segments to move in a tier.
2. The `tier`, `historicals`, and `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` values are used to calculate the number of segments to move in a tier, based on the level of skew between the historicals in the tier.

The `totalSegmentsInTier` value is used to calculate the minimum number of segments to move, which is then used to calculate the number of segments to move in a tier. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` value is used as an upper bound for the number of segments to move.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `totalSegmentsInTier` value is 0, which means there are no segments in the tier. Therefore, the minimum number of segments to move will be 0, and the number of segments to move in the tier will also be 0. Since the `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` value is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, there are no restrictions on the maximum number of segments to move.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `totalSegmentsInTier` value is 1, which means there is only one segment in the tier. Therefore, the minimum number of segments to move will be 1, and the number of segments to move in the tier will also be 1. Since the `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` value is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, there are no restrictions on the maximum number of segments to move.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `totalSegmentsInTier` value is 100,000, which means there are a large number of segments in the tier. Therefore, the minimum number of segments to move will be calculated based on this value, and the number of segments to move in the tier will also be calculated based on the level of skew between the historicals. Since the `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` value is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, there are no restrictions on the maximum number of segments to move.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `totalSegmentsInTier` value is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which means there are a very large number of segments in the tier. Therefore, the minimum number of segments to move will be calculated based on this value, and the number of segments to move in the tier will also be calculated based on the level of skew between the historicals. Since the `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` value is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, there are no restrictions on the maximum number of segments to move.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int totalSegmentsInTier = -1;
String tier = "tier1";
List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `totalSegmentsInTier` value is -1, which is an invalid value. However, the code under test handles this case by setting the lower bound for the minimum number of segments to move to `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE` (a predefined constant value). Therefore, the minimum number of segments to move will be `MIN_SEGMENTS_TO_MOVE`, and the number of segments to move in the tier will also be calculated based on the level of skew between the historicals. Since the `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` value is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, there are no restrictions on the maximum number of segments to move.
