## Inferred Relation
The `isLowerThan` method of the `Version` class compares two versions and returns `true` if the first version is lower than the second version.

The `valueOf` method of the `Version` class takes a version string as input and constructs a `Version` object from it.

Based on the code, it can be inferred that the `isLowerThan` method compares the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of two `Version` objects in the following order of precedence:
1. Major number
2. Minor number
3. Revision number
4. Build number

If any of the numbers are different between the two versions, the comparison stops at that level and the result is determined. If all the numbers are the same, the build number is compared.

## Explanation
To generate the follow-up input `v2` for the new source input `v1 = "1.0-A1"`, we need to find a version that is greater than `v1` and will return `true` when compared using the `isLowerThan` method.

Based on the inferred relation, we can increase the major, minor, revision, or build number of `v1` to create a version that is greater than `v1`.

In this case, we can increase the minor number of `v1` to create a version `v2` that is greater than `v1`. Since the minor number is a decimal number, we can increase it to any value greater than the current value.

Therefore, the follow-up input `v2` can be:
```java
    String v2 = "1.1-A1";
```

This follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because `v2` has a greater minor number than `v1`, and when compared using the `isLowerThan` method, `v1` will be considered lower than `v2`.

## New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1-A1";
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.2.0";
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A2";
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0";
    String v2 = "2.1";
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0-A1";
    String v2 = "2.0-A2";
```

For each new input pair, the follow-up input is constructed by increasing the relevant number in the version string to create a version that is greater than the source input. The follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input has a greater number than the source input at the relevant level of comparison.
