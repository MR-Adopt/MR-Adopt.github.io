## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list. Therefore, if two filters have the same events added in the same order, their internal events lists should be different.

Explanation: In the new source input, both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added in the same order. This ensures that the internal events list of `filter2` will be different from the internal events list of `filter`. Thus, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list. Therefore, if two filters have the same events added in the same order, their internal events lists should be different.

Explanation: In the new source input, both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added in the same order. Additionally, an extra `mockEvent1` is added to both filters. This ensures that the internal events list of `filter2` will be different from the internal events list of `filter`. Thus, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(null);
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(null);
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list. Therefore, if two filters have the same events added in the same order, their internal events lists should be different.

Explanation: In the new source input, both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added in the same order. Additionally, a `null` event is added to both filters. This ensures that the internal events list of `filter2` will be different from the internal events list of `filter`. Thus, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent1);
    filter.add(mockEvent2);
    filter.add(new FilterEventMock());
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent1);
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
    filter2.add(new FilterEventMock());
```

Inferred relation: The `getEventsInternal()` method returns a copy of the internal events list. Therefore, if two filters have the same events added in the same order, their internal events lists should be different.

Explanation: In the new source input, both `filter` and `filter2` have the same events added in the same order. Additionally, a new `FilterEventMock` event is added to both filters. This ensures that the internal events list of `filter2` will be different from the internal events list of `filter`. Thus, the new input pair satisfies the inferred relation.
