## New input pair0:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```

In this case, the follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same field name, column type, and value as the source input `f3`. This ensures that both filters are equivalent and will produce the same cache key when passed to the `IsFalseDimFilter.of()` method.

## New input pair1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```

In this case, the follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using a different field name but the same column type and value as the source input `f3`. Since the field name is different, the resulting cache keys for `f3` and `f4` will also be different, ensuring that the assertion in the original test case will fail.

## New input pair2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.LONG, 123, null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.LONG, 123, null);
```

In this case, the follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same field name, column type, and value as the source input `f3`. This ensures that both filters are equivalent and will produce the same cache key when passed to the `IsFalseDimFilter.of()` method.

## New input pair3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, null, null);
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, null, null);
```

In this case, the follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same field name and column type as the source input `f3`, but with a null value. Since the value is null, the resulting cache keys for `f3` and `f4` will be the same, ensuring that the assertion in the original test case will pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
    EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```

In this case, the follow-up input `f4` is constructed by using the same field name, column type, value, and dimension as the source input `f3`. This ensures that both filters are equivalent and will produce the same cache key when passed to the `IsFalseDimFilter.of()` method.
