## New input pair0:
```java
    Closeable closeable = closeCounter::incrementAndGet;
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

## New input pair1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

## New input pair2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

## New input pair3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[]{1, 2, 3});
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

## New input pair4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new PipedInputStream();
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

## New input pair5:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FilterInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            super.close();
        }
    };
    ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<Closeable>(closeable);
```

Inferred relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `closeable` and the follow-up input `holder2` is that the `closeable` object is passed as a parameter to the constructor of `CloseableResourceHolder` to create the `holder2` object.

Explanation:
For each new source input, we create a `closeable` object of type `Closeable`. Then, we pass this `closeable` object as a parameter to the constructor of `CloseableResourceHolder` to create the `holder2` object. This ensures that the `holder2` object holds the `closeable` resource. The inferred relation is satisfied by this approach because it follows the same pattern as the original test case, where the `closeable` object is passed to the constructor of `CloseableResourceHolder` to create the `holder2` object.
