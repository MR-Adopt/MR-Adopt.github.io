## New input pair0:
```java
    String name = "fever";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "testModule";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "testModule";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom`.

Explanation: In the original test case, `symptom2` is assigned the reference of `symptom` using the statement `symptom2 = symptom;`. This means that both `symptom` and `symptom2` point to the same object in memory. By assigning `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom`, any changes made to `symptom` will also be reflected in `symptom2`. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can simply assign `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom` in the new input pair.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String name = "cough";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module1";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "module1";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom`.

Explanation: Similar to the previous case, the follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom` using the statement `symptom2 = symptom;`. This ensures that both `symptom` and `symptom2` point to the same object in memory. By assigning `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom`, any changes made to `symptom` will also be reflected in `symptom2`. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can simply assign `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom` in the new input pair.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String name = "headache";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module2";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "module2";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom`.

Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom` using the statement `symptom2 = symptom;`. This ensures that both `symptom` and `symptom2` point to the same object in memory. By assigning `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom`, any changes made to `symptom` will also be reflected in `symptom2`. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can simply assign `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom` in the new input pair.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String name = "fatigue";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module3";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "module3";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom`.

Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom` using the statement `symptom2 = symptom;`. This ensures that both `symptom` and `symptom2` point to the same object in memory. By assigning `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom`, any changes made to `symptom` will also be reflected in `symptom2`. Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can simply assign `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom` in the new input pair.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String name = "nausea";
    ExpressedSymptom symptom = new ExpressedSymptom(name);
    String module = "module4";
    symptom.addressSource(module);
    ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
    String module2 = "module4";
    symptom2.addressSource(module2);
```

Inferred relation: The follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom`.

Explanation: Similar to the previous cases, the follow-up input `symptom2` is assigned the same reference as the source input `symptom` using the statement `symptom2 = symptom;`.

Therefore, to satisfy the inferred relation, we can simply assign `symptom2` the same reference as `symptom` in the new input pair.
