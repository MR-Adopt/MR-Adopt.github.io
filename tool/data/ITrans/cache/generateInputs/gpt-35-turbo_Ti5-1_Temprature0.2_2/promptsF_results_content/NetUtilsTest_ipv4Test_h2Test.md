## New input pair0:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "192.168.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 192168000001L;
```
Explanation: 
- The original test case converts the IP address "127.0.0.1" to a long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method and stores it in `ipLong`.
- The original test case then assigns the value 127000000001L to `ipLong2`.
- The original test case converts the long value `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method and stores it in `ipStr2`.
- Finally, the original test case asserts that `ipStr2` is equal to `ipStr1`.

Based on this, we can infer that the `ipv4ToLong` method converts an IP address to a long value, and the `longToIpv4` method converts a long value back to an IP address.

In the new input pair, we use the IP address "192.168.0.1" as the source input `ipStr1`. We calculate the corresponding long value `ipLong2` as 192168000001L. This follows the same pattern as the original test case, where the IP address is converted to a long value and then back to an IP address. The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "10.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 100000001L;
```
Explanation: 
- The original test case converts the IP address "127.0.0.1" to a long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method and stores it in `ipLong`.
- The original test case then assigns the value 127000000001L to `ipLong2`.
- The original test case converts the long value `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method and stores it in `ipStr2`.
- Finally, the original test case asserts that `ipStr2` is equal to `ipStr1`.

Based on this, we can infer that the `ipv4ToLong` method converts an IP address to a long value, and the `longToIpv4` method converts a long value back to an IP address.

In the new input pair, we use the IP address "10.0.0.1" as the source input `ipStr1`. We calculate the corresponding long value `ipLong2` as 100000001L. This follows the same pattern as the original test case, where the IP address is converted to a long value and then back to an IP address. The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "172.16.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 172016000001L;
```
Explanation: 
- The original test case converts the IP address "127.0.0.1" to a long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method and stores it in `ipLong`.
- The original test case then assigns the value 127000000001L to `ipLong2`.
- The original test case converts the long value `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method and stores it in `ipStr2`.
- Finally, the original test case asserts that `ipStr2` is equal to `ipStr1`.

Based on this, we can infer that the `ipv4ToLong` method converts an IP address to a long value, and the `longToIpv4` method converts a long value back to an IP address.

In the new input pair, we use the IP address "172.16.0.1" as the source input `ipStr1`. We calculate the corresponding long value `ipLong2` as 172016000001L. This follows the same pattern as the original test case, where the IP address is converted to a long value and then back to an IP address. The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "8.8.8.8";
    long ipLong2 = 80080008L;
```
Explanation: 
- The original test case converts the IP address "127.0.0.1" to a long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method and stores it in `ipLong`.
- The original test case then assigns the value 127000000001L to `ipLong2`.
- The original test case converts the long value `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method and stores it in `ipStr2`.
- Finally, the original test case asserts that `ipStr2` is equal to `ipStr1`.

Based on this, we can infer that the `ipv4ToLong` method converts an IP address to a long value, and the `longToIpv4` method converts a long value back to an IP address.

In the new input pair, we use the IP address "8.8.8.8" as the source input `ipStr1`. We calculate the corresponding long value `ipLong2` as 80080008L. This follows the same pattern as the original test case, where the IP address is converted to a long value and then back to an IP address. The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the original test case.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String ipStr1 = "127.0.0.1";
    long ipLong2 = 127000000001L;
```
Explanation: 
- The original test case converts the IP address "127.0.0.1" to a long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method and stores it in `ipLong`.
- The original test case then assigns the value 127000000001L to `ipLong2`.
- The original test case converts the long value `ipLong2` back to an IP address using the `longToIpv4` method and stores it in `ipStr2`.
- Finally, the original test case asserts that `ipStr2` is equal to `ipStr1`.

Based on this, we can infer that the `ipv4ToLong` method converts an IP address to a long value, and the `longToIpv4` method converts a long value back to an IP address.

In the new input pair, we use the IP address "127.0.0.1" as the source input `ipStr1`. We calculate the corresponding long value `ipLong2` as 127000000001L. This follows the same pattern as the original test case, where the IP address is converted to a long value and then back to an IP address. The new input pair satisfies the inferred relation and should pass the assertions in the original test case.
