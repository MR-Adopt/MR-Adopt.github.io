## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`text`) is that the `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value.

## New input pair0:
```java
    int year = 2020;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2020-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (2020) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (1). This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair1:
```java
    int year = 1999;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "1999-H2";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (1999) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (2). This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair2:
```java
    int year = 2023;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "2023-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (2023) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (1). This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair3:
```java
    int year = 2005;
    int half = 2;
    CharSequence text = "2005-H2";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (2005) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (2). This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair4:
```java
    int year = 1980;
    int half = 1;
    CharSequence text = "1980-H1";
```
Explanation: The follow-up input `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` (1980) and the letter 'H' followed by the `half` value (1). This satisfies the inferred relation and ensures that the assertion in the original test case passes.
