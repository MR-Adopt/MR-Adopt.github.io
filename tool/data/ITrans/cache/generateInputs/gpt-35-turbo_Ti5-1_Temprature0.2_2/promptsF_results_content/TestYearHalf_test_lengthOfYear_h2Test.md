## New input pair0:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(0, 1);
```

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it creates a new `YearHalf` object using the same year and half values as the source input, which ensures that the `lengthOfYear()` method will return the same value as in the original test case.
