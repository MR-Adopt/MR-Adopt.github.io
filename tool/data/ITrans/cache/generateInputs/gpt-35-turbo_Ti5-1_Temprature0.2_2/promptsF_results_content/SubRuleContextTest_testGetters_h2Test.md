## Inferred Relation
The `generate` method in the `SubRuleContext.Generator` class generates a new `SubRuleContext` object and associates it with a given rule name. The `getNameForGeneratedId` method retrieves the rule name associated with a given ID.

Based on the provided test case, it can be inferred that the `generate` method adds the generated ID to a set associated with the rule name in the `nameToIds` map. The `getNameForGeneratedId` method retrieves the rule name from the `idToName` map using the given ID.

## New input pair 0:
```java
SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
String NAME = "name1";
Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case. The `generate` method is called on `generator` with the rule name "name1", and the `getNameForGeneratedId` method is called on `generator2` with the same ID.

## New input pair 1:
```java
SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
String NAME = "name2";
Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
This new input pair also satisfies the inferred relation. The `generate` method is called on `generator` with the rule name "name2", and the `getNameForGeneratedId` method is called on `generator2` with the same ID.

## New input pair 2:
```java
SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
String NAME = "";
Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation. The `generate` method is called on `generator` with an empty rule name, and the `getNameForGeneratedId` method is called on `generator2` with the same ID.

## New input pair 3:
```java
SubRuleContext.Generator generator = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
String NAME = null;
Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation. The `generate` method is called on `generator` with a null rule name, and the `getNameForGeneratedId` method is called on `generator2` with the same ID.

## New input pair 4:
```java
SubRuleContext.Generator generator = null;
String NAME = "name";
Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation. The `generate` method is called on a null `generator`, which will throw a NullPointerException. The `getNameForGeneratedId` method is called on `generator2` with the same ID.
