This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it sets the same values for `now`, `jw`, and `lts` as the original source input. It also sets the same values for `manifest`, `body`, and `size` as the original follow-up input. Therefore, it ensures that the assertions in the original test case will pass.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it sets different values for `now`, `jw`, and `lts` compared to the original source input. It also sets different values for `manifest`, `body`, and `size` compared to the original follow-up input. Therefore, it ensures that the assertions in the original test case will pass.
