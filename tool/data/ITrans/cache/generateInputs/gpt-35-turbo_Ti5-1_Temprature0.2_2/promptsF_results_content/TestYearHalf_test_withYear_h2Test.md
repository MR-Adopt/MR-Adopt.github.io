## Inferred Relation
Based on the given test case, it can be inferred that the `withYear` method of the `YearHalf` class replaces the year component of a `YearHalf` object with a new year value, while keeping the half-of-year component unchanged.

## Explanation
To generate the follow-up input for a given source input, we need to create a new `YearHalf` object with the same half-of-year component as the source input, but with a different year value.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year1 = 2000;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2005;
int year3 = 2005;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input has `year1` as 2000 and `half1` as 1. The follow-up input is created by setting `year3` as 2005 (the desired new year value) and `half3` as 1 (same as `half1`). This ensures that the `YearHalf` object created with the follow-up input will have the same half-of-year component as the source input, but with a different year value.

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year1 = 2021;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 2022;
int year3 = 2022;
int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input has `year1` as 2021 and `half1` as 2. The follow-up input is created by setting `year3` as 2022 (the desired new year value) and `half3` as 2 (same as `half1`). This ensures that the `YearHalf` object created with the follow-up input will have the same half-of-year component as the source input, but with a different year value.

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year1 = 1999;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2000;
int year3 = 2000;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input has `year1` as 1999 and `half1` as 1. The follow-up input is created by setting `year3` as 2000 (the desired new year value) and `half3` as 1 (same as `half1`). This ensures that the `YearHalf` object created with the follow-up input will have the same half-of-year component as the source input, but with a different year value.

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year1 = 2022;
int half1 = 1;
int year2 = 2023;
int year3 = 2023;
int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input has `year1` as 2022 and `half1` as 1. The follow-up input is created by setting `year3` as 2023 (the desired new year value) and `half3` as 1 (same as `half1`). This ensures that the `YearHalf` object created with the follow-up input will have the same half-of-year component as the source input, but with a different year value.

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year1 = 1900;
int half1 = 2;
int year2 = 1901;
int year3 = 1901;
int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this case, the source input has `year1` as 1900 and `half1` as 2. The follow-up input is created by setting `year3` as 1901 (the desired new year value) and `half3` as 2 (same as `half1`). This ensures that the `YearHalf` object created with the follow-up input will have the same half-of-year component as the source input, but with a different year value.
