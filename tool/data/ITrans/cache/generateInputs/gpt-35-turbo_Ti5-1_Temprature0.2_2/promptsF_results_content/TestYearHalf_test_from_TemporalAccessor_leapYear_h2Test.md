# Inferred Relation
Based on the given original test case and the code under test, we can infer the following relation between the source input `date` and the follow-up inputs `year` and `expected`:

1. The `year` is obtained from the `date` by extracting the year field.
2. The `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date`. It is calculated as ((monthValue - 1) / 6) + 1.

# New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```

Explanation:
In this new input pair, we set the `date` to July 1, 2022. 
- The `year` is obtained from the `date` as 2022.
- The `expected` is calculated as ((7 - 1) / 6) + 1 = 2, since July is in the second half of the year.

This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same logic as the original test case. The `year` is obtained correctly from the `date`, and the `expected` is calculated correctly based on the month value of the `date`.
