## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) and the follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) is that the follow-up inputs are the same as the source inputs except for `half3`, which is equal to `half2`.

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year1 = 2007;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2007;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) are the same as the original test case. The follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are also the same as the source inputs, as `half3` is equal to `half2`. This satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year1 = 2022;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2022;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) are different from the original test case. The follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are the same as the source inputs, as `half3` is equal to `half2`. This satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year1 = 1999;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 1999;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) are different from the original test case. The follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are the same as the source inputs, as `half3` is equal to `half2`. This satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year1 = 2025;
    int half1 = 1;
    int half2 = 1;
    int year3 = 2025;
    int half3 = 1;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) are different from the original test case. The follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are the same as the source inputs, as `half3` is equal to `half2`. This satisfies the inferred relation.

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year1 = 2010;
    int half1 = 2;
    int half2 = 2;
    int year3 = 2010;
    int half3 = 2;
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the source inputs (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) are different from the original test case. The follow-up inputs (`year3`, `half3`) are the same as the source inputs, as `half3` is equal to `half2`. This satisfies the inferred relation.
