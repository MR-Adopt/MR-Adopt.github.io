## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input `queryTitle` and the follow-up input `queryTitle2` is that they both represent the same query to find the first matching element in the parsed document.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `expectFirst()` method is called with the `queryTitle` to find the first matching element. The `selectFirst()` method is then called with the same `queryTitle2` to find the first matching element again. The assertion `assertSame(title2, title)` checks if both elements are the same, indicating that they represent the same query.

## New input pair 0:
```java
StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
String queryTitle = "p";
String queryTitle2 = "p";
```
In this new input pair, the source input `queryTitle` is set to `"p"`, which represents a query to find the first `<p>` element in the parsed document. The follow-up input `queryTitle2` is also set to `"p"`, representing the same query. This satisfies the inferred relation that both queries should represent the same query to find the first matching element.

## New input pair 1:
```java
StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
String queryTitle = "div";
String queryTitle2 = "div";
```
In this new input pair, the source input `queryTitle` is set to `"div"`, which represents a query to find the first `<div>` element in the parsed document. The follow-up input `queryTitle2` is also set to `"div"`, representing the same query. This satisfies the inferred relation that both queries should represent the same query to find the first matching element.

## New input pair 2:
```java
StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
String queryTitle = "p[id=1]";
String queryTitle2 = "p[id=1]";
```
In this new input pair, the source input `queryTitle` is set to `"p[id=1]"`, which represents a query to find the first `<p>` element with the attribute `id` equal to `"1"` in the parsed document. The follow-up input `queryTitle2` is also set to `"p[id=1]"`, representing the same query. This satisfies the inferred relation that both queries should represent the same query to find the first matching element.

## New input pair 3:
```java
StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
String queryTitle = "p:contains(One)";
String queryTitle2 = "p:contains(One)";
```
In this new input pair, the source input `queryTitle` is set to `"p:contains(One)"`, which represents a query to find the first `<p>` element that contains the text `"One"` in the parsed document. The follow-up input `queryTitle2` is also set to `"p:contains(One)"`, representing the same query. This satisfies the inferred relation that both queries should represent the same query to find the first matching element.

## New input pair 4:
```java
StreamParser parser = new StreamParser(Parser.htmlParser()).parse("<title>One</title><p id=1>P One</p><p id=2>P Two</p>", "");
String queryTitle = "p:first-child";
String queryTitle2 = "p:first-child";
```
In this new input pair, the source input `queryTitle` is set to `"p:first-child"`, which represents a query to find the first `<p>` element that is the first child of its parent in the parsed document. The follow-up input `queryTitle2` is also set to `"p:first-child"`, representing the same query. This satisfies the inferred relation that both queries should represent the same query to find the first matching element.
