## Inferred Relation
The `valueOf` method takes a version string as input and splits it into major, minor, revision, and build components. The major, minor, and revision components are split using a dot ('.') as the delimiter, while the build component is split using a hyphen ('-') as the delimiter. The major, minor, revision, and build components are then used to create a new `Version` object.

Based on the given test case, it can be inferred that the `isEqual` method of the `Version` class compares two `Version` objects and returns `true` if they are equal, and `false` otherwise.

## New input pair 0:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.0";
```
This input pair satisfies the inferred relation because both `v1` and `v2` have the same major, minor, revision, and build components. Therefore, the `isEqual` method should return `true`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.0.1";
```
This input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `v1` has a major version of "1", a minor version of "0", and no revision or build components. `v2` has a major version of "1", a minor version of "0", a revision version of "1", and no build component. Therefore, `v1` is considered to be a lower version than `v2`, and the `isEqual` method should return `false`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.0-A1";
```
This input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `v1` has a major version of "1", a minor version of "0", and no revision or build components. `v2` has a major version of "1", a minor version of "0", no revision component, and a build component of "A1". Therefore, `v1` is considered to be a lower version than `v2`, and the `isEqual` method should return `false`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "1.1";
```
This input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `v1` has a major version of "1", a minor version of "0", and no revision or build components. `v2` has a major version of "1", a minor version of "1", and no revision or build components. Therefore, `v1` is considered to be a lower version than `v2`, and the `isEqual` method should return `false`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
String v1 = "1.0";
String v2 = "2.0";
```
This input pair satisfies the inferred relation because `v1` has a major version of "1", a minor version of "0", and no revision or build components. `v2` has a major version of "2", a minor version of "0", and no revision or build components. Therefore, `v1` is considered to be a lower version than `v2`, and the `isEqual` method should return `false`.

## Complete code for the new input pairs
```java
@Test
public void isEqualTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.0";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertTrue(a.isEqual(b));
}

@Test
public void isEqualTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.0.1";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isEqual(b));
}

@Test
public void isEqualTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.0-A1";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isEqual(b));
}

@Test
public void isEqualTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isEqual(b));
}

@Test
public void isEqualTest() {
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "2.0";
    Version a = Version.valueOf(v1);
    Version b = Version.valueOf(v2);
    assertFalse(a.isEqual(b));
}
```

The new input pairs satisfy the inferred relation and pass the assertions in the original test case.
