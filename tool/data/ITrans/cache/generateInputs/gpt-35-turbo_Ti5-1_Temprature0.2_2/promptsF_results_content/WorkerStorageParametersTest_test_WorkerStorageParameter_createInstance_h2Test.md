## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `l` and the follow-up inputs `l2` and `b` is as follows:
- If `l` is greater than 0 and `b` is true, then `l2` should be equal to `l`.

## Explanation:
The method `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstance` creates an instance of `WorkerStorageParameters` based on the provided parameters. If `isIntermediateSuperSorterStorageEnabled` is false or `tmpStorageBytesPerTask` is -1, then it returns an instance with `-1` as the storage bytes. Otherwise, it performs some calculations and returns an instance with `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` as the storage bytes.

In the original test case, the `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstanceForTests` method is called with `l` as the parameter, and the `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstance` method is called with `l2` and `b` as the parameters. The test case asserts that the instances created by these two methods are equal.

Based on the code and the original test case, we can infer that if `l` is greater than 0 and `b` is true, then the `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstance` method will calculate `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` based on `l` and return an instance with `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` as the storage bytes. Therefore, in order to satisfy the inferred relation, `l2` should be equal to `l`.

## New input pair0:
```java
    long l = 0;
    long l2 = 0;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In this case, since `l` is 0, the `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstance` method will return an instance with `-1` as the storage bytes. Therefore, `l2` should also be 0 to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair1:
```java
    long l = 1;
    long l2 = 1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In this case, since `l` is 1, the `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstance` method will calculate `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` based on `l` and return an instance with `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` as the storage bytes. Therefore, `l2` should also be 1 to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair2:
```java
    long l = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    long l2 = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In this case, since `l` is `Long.MAX_VALUE`, the `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstance` method will calculate `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` based on `l` and return an instance with `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` as the storage bytes. Therefore, `l2` should also be `Long.MAX_VALUE` to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair3:
```java
    long l = -1;
    long l2 = -1;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In this case, since `l` is -1, the `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstance` method will return an instance with `-1` as the storage bytes. Therefore, `l2` should also be -1 to satisfy the inferred relation.

## New input pair4:
```java
    long l = 100000000;
    long l2 = 100000000;
    boolean b = true;
```
Explanation: In this case, since `l` is 100000000, the `WorkerStorageParameters.createInstance` method will calculate `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` based on `l` and return an instance with `intermediateSuperSorterStorageMaxLocalBytes` as the storage bytes. Therefore, `l2` should also be 100000000 to satisfy the inferred relation.
