To infer the relation between the source input `taskId1` and the follow-up input `taskId2`, we need to understand the behavior of the `convertTaskIdToJobName` method.

The `convertTaskIdToJobName` method takes a `taskId` as input and converts it to a job name. It removes a specific pattern from the `taskId`, converts it to lowercase, and then appends a hash of the original `taskId` to the result.

Based on the given test case, we can infer that the method is designed to avoid duplicate job names. If two `taskId` values have the same job name, it means that they are considered duplicates.

To generate the follow-up input `taskId2` for a given source input `taskId1`, we need to modify `taskId1` in a way that it produces a different job name than `taskId1`.

Here are the new input pairs:

## New input pair 0:
```java
String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_117_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
Explanation: In this case, we simply increment the last digit of `taskId1` to generate `taskId2`. This change ensures that the resulting job names are different.

## New input pair 1:
```java
String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_5678_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinsouthamerica_agg_summ_118_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_5678_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinsouthamerica_agg_summ_119_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z";
```
Explanation: Similar to the previous case, we increment the last digit of `taskId1` to generate `taskId2`. This change ensures that the resulting job names are different.

## New input pair 2:
```java
String taskId1 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z_extra";
String taskId2 = "coordinator-issued_compact_1234_telemetry_wikipedia_geteditfailuresinnorthamerica_agg_summ_116_pcgkebcl_2023-07-19T16:53:11.416Z_extra2";
```
Explanation: In this case, we add the suffix "_extra2" to `taskId1` to generate `taskId2`. This change ensures that the resulting job names are different.

The code to generate the follow-up input for each new source input is straightforward. We modify the source input in a way that guarantees a different job name.
