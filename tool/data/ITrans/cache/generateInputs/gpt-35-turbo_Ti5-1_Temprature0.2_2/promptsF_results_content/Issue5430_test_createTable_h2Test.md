## New input pair0:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint)";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint)";
```

The follow-up input `newSql` is obtained by removing the unnecessary spaces between the column names and their data types in the source input `sql`. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should have the same table creation statement as the source input, but with normalized spacing.

## New input pair1:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.JsonSerDe' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

The follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input `sql` because it is already in the normalized format. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input if it is already in the normalized format.

## New input pair2:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE";
```

The follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input `sql` because it is already in the normalized format. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input if it is already in the normalized format.

## New input pair3:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) STORED AS PARQUET";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) STORED AS PARQUET";
```

The follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input `sql` because it is already in the normalized format. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input if it is already in the normalized format.

## New input pair4:
```java
    String sql = "CREATE TABLE my_table(a string, b bigint) LOCATION '/path/to/table'";
    String newSql = "CREATE TABLE my_table (a string,b bigint) LOCATION '/path/to/table'";
```

The follow-up input `newSql` is the same as the source input `sql` because it is already in the normalized format. This satisfies the inferred relation that the follow-up input should be the same as the source input if it is already in the normalized format.
