## Inferred Relation:
The `setDeviceBus` method sets the `deviceBus` property of the `i2cMux` object to the provided value. The `getDeviceBus` method returns the value of the `config.bus` property of the `i2cMux` object.

## Explanation:
Based on the inferred relation, the `deviceBus` property of the `i2cMux` object is set using the `setDeviceBus` method. The value of this property can be retrieved using the `getDeviceBus` method. The `assertEquals` assertion in the original test case checks if the value of `deviceBus` is equal to the value returned by `i2cMux2.getDeviceBus()`.

To generate the follow-up input, we can create a new `i2cMux2` object and set its `deviceBus` property to the same value as the `deviceBus` property of the `i2cMux` object. This will ensure that the `assertEquals` assertion in the original test case passes.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "0";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "0" for both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2` objects. This ensures that the `assertEquals` assertion in the original test case passes because the `deviceBus` value of `i2cMux2` will be "0" after calling `i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus)`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "7";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "7" for both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2` objects. This ensures that the `assertEquals` assertion in the original test case passes because the `deviceBus` value of `i2cMux2` will be "7" after calling `i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus)`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "3";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "3" for both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2` objects. This ensures that the `assertEquals` assertion in the original test case passes because the `deviceBus` value of `i2cMux2` will be "3" after calling `i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus)`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "5";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "5" for both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2` objects. This ensures that the `assertEquals` assertion in the original test case passes because the `deviceBus` value of `i2cMux2` will be "5" after calling `i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus)`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceBus = "2";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
i2cMux.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus);
```
In this new input pair, the `deviceBus` value is set to "2" for both `i2cMux` and `i2cMux2` objects. This ensures that the `assertEquals` assertion in the original test case passes because the `deviceBus` value of `i2cMux2` will be "2" after calling `i2cMux2.setDeviceBus(deviceBus)`.
