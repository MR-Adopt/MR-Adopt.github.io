## Inferred Relation:
The method `addTo` in the `YearQuarter` class adds the specified amount of quarters to the given `YearQuarter` object and returns the resulting `YearQuarter` object. The inferred relation between the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`) and the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`, `amount`) is that the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) should be the result of adding the specified amount of quarters to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`).

## New input pair 0:
```java
    int year1 = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = Year.MIN_VALUE;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) is obtained by adding 1 quarter to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`).

## New input pair 1:
```java
    int year1 = 2022;
    int quarter1 = 3;
    int year2 = 2022;
    int quarter2 = 4;
    int amount = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) is obtained by adding 1 quarter to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`).

## New input pair 2:
```java
    int year1 = 2023;
    int quarter1 = 1;
    int year2 = 2023;
    int quarter2 = 2;
    int amount = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) is obtained by adding 1 quarter to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`).

## New input pair 3:
```java
    int year1 = 2024;
    int quarter1 = 2;
    int year2 = 2024;
    int quarter2 = 3;
    int amount = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) is obtained by adding 1 quarter to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`).

## New input pair 4:
```java
    int year1 = Year.MAX_VALUE;
    int quarter1 = 4;
    int year2 = Year.MAX_VALUE;
    int quarter2 = 1;
    int amount = 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the follow-up input (`year2`, `quarter2`) is obtained by adding 1 quarter to the source input (`year1`, `quarter1`).

The follow-up inputs for the new source inputs are constructed by adding 1 quarter to the respective source inputs. This ensures that the follow-up inputs adhere to the inferred relation and pass the assertions in the original test case.
