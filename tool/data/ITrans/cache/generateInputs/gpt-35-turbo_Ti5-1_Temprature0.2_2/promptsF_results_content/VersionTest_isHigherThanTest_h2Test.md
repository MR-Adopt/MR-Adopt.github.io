## Inferred Relation
The `isHigherThan` method in the `Version` class compares two versions and returns `true` if the first version is higher than the second version. The comparison is done based on the major, minor, revision, and build numbers of the versions.

The `valueOf` method in the `Version` class parses a version string and constructs a `Version` object. The version string is split into major, minor, revision, and build numbers. If the version string contains a revision number, it is split into revision and build numbers. If the version string contains a minor number but no revision number, the minor number is split into minor and build numbers. If the version string contains only a major number, the major number is split into major and build numbers.

## Explanation
Based on the `valueOf` method, the version string is split into major, minor, revision, and build numbers. The major, minor, revision, and build numbers are then used to construct a `Version` object.

To generate the follow-up input for each new source input, we need to ensure that the version strings can be parsed correctly and the resulting `Version` objects have the expected values.

### New input pair0:
```java
    String v1 = "1.0";
    String v2 = "1.10";
```
The follow-up input `v2` is generated by changing the minor number of the source input `v1` to a higher value. This ensures that the resulting `Version` object for `v2` will have a higher minor number than the resulting `Version` object for `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is not higher than `v2`.

### New input pair1:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0";
    String v2 = "1.1.0-A1";
```
The follow-up input `v2` is generated by appending a build number to the source input `v1`. This ensures that the resulting `Version` object for `v2` will have a build number, while the resulting `Version` object for `v1` will not have a build number. Therefore, `v1` is not higher than `v2`.

### New input pair2:
```java
    String v1 = "1.1.0-A1";
    String v2 = "2.0";
```
The follow-up input `v2` is generated by changing the major number of the source input `v1` to a higher value. This ensures that the resulting `Version` object for `v2` will have a higher major number than the resulting `Version` object for `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is not higher than `v2`.

### New input pair3:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0";
    String v2 = "2.0-A1";
```
The follow-up input `v2` is generated by appending a build number to the source input `v1`. This ensures that the resulting `Version` object for `v2` will have a build number, while the resulting `Version` object for `v1` will not have a build number. Therefore, `v1` is not higher than `v2`.

### New input pair4:
```java
    String v1 = "2.0-A1";
    String v2 = "2.0-A2";
```
The follow-up input `v2` is generated by changing the build number of the source input `v1` to a higher value. This ensures that the resulting `Version` object for `v2` will have a higher build number than the resulting `Version` object for `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is not higher than `v2`.

The follow-up inputs for the new source inputs satisfy the inferred relation because they ensure that the resulting `Version` objects have the expected values for comparison in the `isHigherThan` method.
