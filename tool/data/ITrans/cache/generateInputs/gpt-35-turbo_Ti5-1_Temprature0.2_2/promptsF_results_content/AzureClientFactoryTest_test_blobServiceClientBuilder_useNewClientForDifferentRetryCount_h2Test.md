## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source inputs (`retryCount1`, `ACCOUNT1`) and the follow-up inputs (`retryCount2`, `ACCOUNT2`) is that if the `retryCount1` is `null`, it is replaced with the value of `config.getMaxTries()` in the `getBlobServiceClient` method. Otherwise, the `retryCount1` is used as is.

## New input pair0:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `retryCount1` is not `null`, so it is used as is in both the source and follow-up inputs.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `retryCount1` is not `null`, so it is used as is in both the source and follow-up inputs.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `retryCount1` is not `null`, so it is used as is in both the source and follow-up inputs.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
    Integer retryCount2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "account";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `retryCount1` is not `null`, so it is used as is in both the source and follow-up inputs.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
    Integer retryCount2 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT2 = "";
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `retryCount1` is not `null`, so it is used as is in both the source and follow-up inputs. Additionally, the `ACCOUNT1` and `ACCOUNT2` are both empty strings, which is a valid input according to the original test case.
