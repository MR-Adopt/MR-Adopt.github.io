## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the `executor` and `support` objects is that the `support` object is created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` method as one of its parameters.

## Explanation:
In the original test case, the `executor` object is created with a thread-pool id and then the `support` object is created using the same thread-pool id obtained from the `executor` object. The test case asserts that the thread-pool id obtained from the `executor` object is equal to the thread-pool id obtained from the `support` object.

To generate the follow-up input for a new `executor` object, we can create a new `support` object using the same thread-pool id obtained from the new `executor` object.

## New input pair 0:
```java
@Test
public void testGetThreadPoolId() {
    ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
    ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
    Assert.assertEquals(executor.getThreadPoolId(), support.getThreadPoolId());

    // New source input
    ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor newExecutor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("newTest", manager, 10, 10, 2000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
    ThreadPoolPluginSupport newSupport = new TestSupport(newExecutor.getThreadPoolId(), newExecutor, manager);
    Assert.assertEquals(newExecutor.getThreadPoolId(), newSupport.getThreadPoolId());
}
```

In this new input pair, a new `executor` object (`newExecutor`) is created with a different thread-pool id. The `support` object (`newSupport`) is then created using the thread-pool id obtained from the `newExecutor` object. The test case asserts that the thread-pool id obtained from the `newExecutor` object is equal to the thread-pool id obtained from the `newSupport` object. This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because it follows the same pattern as the original test case, creating the `support` object using the thread-pool id obtained from the `executor` object.
