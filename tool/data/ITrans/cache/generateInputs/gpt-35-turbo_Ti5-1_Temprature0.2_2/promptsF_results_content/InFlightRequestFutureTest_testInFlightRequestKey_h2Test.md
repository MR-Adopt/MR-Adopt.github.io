## New input pair0:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", 0, 1);
```

Explanation: The inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method of `InFlightRequestKey` only considers the `group` field. Therefore, as long as the `group` field is the same, the hash code will be the same. In the new input pair, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` field value of "group", so their hash codes will be the same.

## New input pair1:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group2", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group2", 1, 1);
```

Explanation: Similar to the previous input pair, the inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method of `InFlightRequestKey` only considers the `group` field. In this new input pair, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` field value of "group2", so their hash codes will be the same.

## New input pair2:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("", 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("", 1, 1);
```

Explanation: Again, the inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method of `InFlightRequestKey` only considers the `group` field. In this new input pair, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have an empty `group` field, so their hash codes will be the same.

## New input pair3:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey(null, 0, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey(null, 1, 1);
```

Explanation: As before, the inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method of `InFlightRequestKey` only considers the `group` field. In this new input pair, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have a `null` `group` field, so their hash codes will be the same.

## New input pair4:
```java
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey1 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", -1, 0);
    InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey("group", -1, 1);
```

Explanation: Once again, the inferred relation is that the `hashCode()` method of `InFlightRequestKey` only considers the `group` field. In this new input pair, both `requestKey1` and `requestKey2` have the same `group` field value of "group", so their hash codes will be the same. Additionally, the other fields (`0` and `-1`) are different, which ensures that the objects are not considered equal.
