## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `job2Detail` and the follow-up input `job22` is that `job22` is the key of the job stored in the scheduler that corresponds to the `job2Detail`.

## Explanation:
In the original test case, the `job2Detail` is added to the scheduler using the `addJob` method. Then, the `getJobDetail` method is called with the `job22` key to retrieve the job detail from the scheduler. The assertion checks if the retrieved job detail is equal to the `job2Detail`.

To satisfy the inferred relation, the follow-up input `job22` should be the key of the job that corresponds to the `job2Detail` in the scheduler.

## New input pair 0:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", GROUP_KEY);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` key. Therefore, it corresponds to the same job stored in the scheduler.

## New input pair 1:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY)).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job3", GROUP_KEY);
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` key. Therefore, it corresponds to the same job stored in the scheduler.

## New input pair 2:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job2", "GROUP_KEY2")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job2", "GROUP_KEY2");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` key. Therefore, it corresponds to the same job stored in the scheduler.

## New input pair 3:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job4", "GROUP_KEY2")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job4", "GROUP_KEY2");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` key. Therefore, it corresponds to the same job stored in the scheduler.

## New input pair 4:
```java
JobDetail job2Detail = newJob(HelloJob.class).withIdentity(new JobKey("job5", "GROUP_KEY3")).storeDurably().build();
JobKey job22 = new JobKey("job5", "GROUP_KEY3");
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because the `job22` key is created with the same name and group as the `job2Detail` key. Therefore, it corresponds to the same job stored in the scheduler.
