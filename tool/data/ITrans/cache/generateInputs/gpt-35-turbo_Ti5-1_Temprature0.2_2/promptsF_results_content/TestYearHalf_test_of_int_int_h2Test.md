## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`test2`) is that the `year` and `half` values of the follow-up input should be the same as the source input values.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `YearHalf.of()` method is called twice with the same `year` and `half` values to create two `YearHalf` objects (`test` and `test2`). The assertions then check if the `year` and `half` values of `test` and `test2` match the source input values.

To generate the follow-up input (`test2`), we can use the same `year` and `half` values as the source input. This ensures that the `test2` object will have the same `year` and `half` values as the source input, satisfying the inferred relation.

## New input pair 0:
```java
int year = 0;
int half = 1;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair 1:
```java
int year = 9999;
int half = 2;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair 2:
```java
int year = 2022;
int half = 1;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair 3:
```java
int year = 2000;
int half = 2;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

## New input pair 4:
```java
int year = 2024;
int half = 2;
YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
```

In each of the new input pairs, the `test2` object is created using the same `year` and `half` values as the source input. This ensures that the `test2` object will have the same `year` and `half` values as the source input, satisfying the inferred relation.
