## New input pair0:
```java
    YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half.getValue());
```

Explanation: In the original test case, the `YearHalf` object `test2` is created using the `YearHalf.of()` method with the `year` and `halfValue` as parameters. The `halfValue` is obtained from `half` using the `getValue()` method. Therefore, in the new input pair, we can directly pass `half.getValue()` as the second argument to the `YearHalf.of()` method to create the `test2` object. This ensures that the follow-up input satisfies the inferred relation and passes the assertion in the original test case.
