## Inferred Relation
The inferred relation between the source input (`i2cMux`, `deviceAddress`) and the follow-up input (`i2cMux2`) is that when the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceAddress`, the `getDeviceAddress` method should return the same `deviceAddress` value on `i2cMux2`.

## Explanation
In the original test case, the `setDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux` with the `deviceAddress` value. Then, the `getDeviceAddress` method is called on `i2cMux2` and the returned value is compared with the `deviceAddress` value. The test case passes if the two values are equal.

To generate the follow-up input, we can use the same source input code and create a new instance of `i2cMux2` using the same name and type as `i2cMux`. This ensures that the `getDeviceAddress` method is called on the correct instance.

## New input pair 0:
```java
I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
String deviceAddress = "0x70";
I2cMux i2cMux2 = i2cMux;
```

In this new input pair, the `i2cMux` instance is created and assigned to `i2cMux2`. Since `i2cMux2` refers to the same instance as `i2cMux`, the `getDeviceAddress` method will return the same value as `deviceAddress`, satisfying the inferred relation.
