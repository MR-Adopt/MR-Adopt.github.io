## New input pair0:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = null;
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = null;
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `mockEvent` and `filter` are used to add an event to `filter` and then `filter2` is created and `mockEvent2` is added to it. Since both `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` are null, the `getNewEvents()` method will return an empty array. Therefore, in the follow-up input pair, we can set both `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` to null and create new instances of `Filter` for `filter` and `filter2` to ensure that the assertions pass.

## New input pair1:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = null;
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = null;
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `mockEvent` is added to `filter` and `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. Since both `filter` and `filter2` are null, the `getNewEvents()` method will throw a NullPointerException. Therefore, in the follow-up input pair, we can set both `filter` and `filter2` to null and create new instances of `FilterEventMock` for `mockEvent` and `mockEvent2` to ensure that the assertions pass.

## New input pair2:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `mockEvent` is added to `filter` and `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. In the follow-up input pair, we can reuse `mockEvent` and `filter` from the source input and create a new instance of `Filter` for `filter2`. Then, `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2` to ensure that the assertions pass.

## New input pair3:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `mockEvent` is added to `filter` and `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. In the follow-up input pair, we can reuse `mockEvent` and `filter` from the source input and create a new instance of `Filter` for `filter2`. Then, `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2` to ensure that the assertions pass.

## New input pair4:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `mockEvent` is added twice to `filter` and `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. In the follow-up input pair, we can reuse `mockEvent` and `filter` from the source input and create a new instance of `Filter` for `filter2`. Then, `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2` to ensure that the assertions pass. Adding `mockEvent` twice to `filter` does not affect the result of `getNewEvents()` as it only returns the events that were added after the last call to `getNewEvents()`. 

## New input pair5:
```java
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter = new Filter();
    filter.add(mockEvent);
    filter.add(null);
    Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
    Filter filter2 = new Filter();
    filter2.add(mockEvent2);
```

Explanation: In the original test case, `mockEvent` is added to `filter` and `null` is also added to `filter`. `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2`. In the follow-up input pair, we can reuse `mockEvent` and `filter` from the source input and create a new instance of `Filter` for `filter2`. Then, `mockEvent2` is added to `filter2` to ensure that the assertions pass. Adding `null` to `filter` does not affect the result of `getNewEvents()` as it only returns the events that were added after the last call to `getNewEvents()`.
