## Inferred Relation:
The inferred relation between the source input `ap` and the follow-up input `type` is that the `type` should be the same as the activity type of the `ap` object.

## Explanation:
The method `addActivityParams` in the `ScoringConfigGroup` class adds an `ActivityParams` object to the list of activity parameters. Before adding the new `ActivityParams` object, it checks if there is already an existing `ActivityParams` object with the same activity type. If there is, it removes the existing object and adds the new one. The activity type is obtained from the `ActivityParams` object using the `getActivityType()` method.

In the original test case, the `addActivityParams` method is called with an `ActivityParams` object `ap` and the activity type is obtained from the `type` variable. The test case asserts that the `ActivityParams` object retrieved using the activity type is equal to the `ap` object.

Based on this understanding, the follow-up input `type` should be the same as the activity type of the `ap` object.

## New input pair 0:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type2");
String type = "type2";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ActivityParams` object `ap` has an activity type of "type2". The `type` variable is set to "type2", which matches the activity type of `ap`.

## New input pair 1:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type3");
String type = "type3";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ActivityParams` object `ap` has an activity type of "type3". The `type` variable is set to "type3", which matches the activity type of `ap`.

## New input pair 2:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type4");
String type = "type4";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ActivityParams` object `ap` has an activity type of "type4". The `type` variable is set to "type4", which matches the activity type of `ap`.

## New input pair 3:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type5");
String type = "type5";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ActivityParams` object `ap` has an activity type of "type5". The `type` variable is set to "type5", which matches the activity type of `ap`.

## New input pair 4:
```java
ActivityParams ap = new ActivityParams("type6");
String type = "type6";
```
Explanation: In this new input pair, the `ActivityParams` object `ap` has an activity type of "type6". The `type` variable is set to "type6", which matches the activity type of `ap`.
