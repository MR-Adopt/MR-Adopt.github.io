# Inferred Relation
Based on the given original test case and the code under test, we can infer the following relation between the source inputs (`date`) and the follow-up inputs (`year` and `expected`):

1. The `year` is obtained from the `date` by extracting the year value using the `getLong(YEAR)` method.
2. The `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date` using the formula `((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1`.

# New input pair 0:
```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 7, 1);
int year = 2022;
int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
```
This new input pair satisfies the inferred relation because:
- The `year` is set to the year value extracted from the `date`, which is 2022.
- The `expected` is calculated based on the month value of the `date`, which is 7. Applying the formula `((7 - 1) / 6) + 1` gives the expected value of 2.

By using this new input pair, the assertions in the original test case will pass.
