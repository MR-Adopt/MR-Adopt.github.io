## New input1:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(0);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when the pool size is set to 0. It is important to verify that the program handles this edge case correctly and does not throw any exceptions or cause any unexpected behavior.

## New input2:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(10);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when the pool size is set to a larger value. It is important to verify that the program can handle a larger pool size and allocate resources accordingly.

## New input3:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(-1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when the pool size is set to a negative value. It is important to verify that the program handles this edge case correctly and does not throw any exceptions or cause any unexpected behavior.

## New input4:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when the pool size is set to the maximum value of an integer. It is important to verify that the program can handle such a large pool size and allocate resources accordingly.

## New input5:
```java
    HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(1);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when the pool size is set to the minimum valid value. It is important to verify that the program can handle a small pool size and allocate resources accordingly.
