## New input1:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
```
This input is valid because it creates a `FileInputStream` object which implements the `Closeable` interface. It represents a closeable resource that can be used in the `ResourceHolder` class.

## New input2:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
```
This input is valid because it creates a `Socket` object which implements the `Closeable` interface. It represents a closeable resource that can be used in the `ResourceHolder` class.

## New input3:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new ByteArrayInputStream(new byte[]{1, 2, 3});
```
This input is valid because it creates a `ByteArrayInputStream` object which implements the `Closeable` interface. It represents a closeable resource that can be used in the `ResourceHolder` class.

## New input4:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new PipedInputStream();
```
This input is valid because it creates a `PipedInputStream` object which implements the `Closeable` interface. It represents a closeable resource that can be used in the `ResourceHolder` class.

## New input5:
```java
    Closeable closeable = new FilterInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
        @Override
        public void close() throws IOException {
            super.close();
            // Additional custom close logic
        }
    };
```
This input is valid because it creates a custom `FilterInputStream` object which extends `FilterInputStream` and implements the `Closeable` interface. It represents a closeable resource that can be used in the `ResourceHolder` class. The custom close logic can be used to perform additional cleanup or resource release operations.
