## New input1:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x71";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x71", which is a valid address within the range specified in the method documentation ("0x70" - "0x77").

## New input2:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x72";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x72", which is a valid address within the range specified in the method documentation ("0x70" - "0x77").

## New input3:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x73";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x73", which is a valid address within the range specified in the method documentation ("0x70" - "0x77").

## New input4:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x74";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x74", which is a valid address within the range specified in the method documentation ("0x70" - "0x77").

## New input5:
```java
    I2cMux i2cMux = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
    String deviceAddress = "0x75";
```
Explanation: This input sets the `deviceAddress` to "0x75", which is a valid address within the range specified in the method documentation ("0x70" - "0x77").

These new inputs explore different valid addresses within the specified range, ensuring that the program correctly handles different valid inputs.
