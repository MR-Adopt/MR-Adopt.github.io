## New input1:
```java
    int year = 0;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: This input tests the minimum valid value for the `year` parameter. The `year` parameter is expected to be from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR, and this input tests the lower bound of that range.

## New input2:
```java
    int year = 9999;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input tests the maximum valid value for the `year` parameter. The `year` parameter is expected to be from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR, and this input tests the upper bound of that range.

## New input3:
```java
    int year = 2022;
    int half = 1;
```
Explanation: This input tests a valid value for the `year` parameter that is within the expected range. It is a current year value and can be used to verify the correctness of the method for recent years.

## New input4:
```java
    int year = 2000;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input tests a valid value for the `year` parameter that is within the expected range. It is a past year value and can be used to verify the correctness of the method for historical years.

## New input5:
```java
    int year = 2024;
    int half = 2;
```
Explanation: This input tests a valid value for the `year` parameter that is within the expected range. It is a future year value and can be used to verify the correctness of the method for future years.
