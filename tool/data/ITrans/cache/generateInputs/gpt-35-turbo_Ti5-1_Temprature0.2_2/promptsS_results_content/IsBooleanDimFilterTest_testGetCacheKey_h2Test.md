## New input1:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "world", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with the same field name, column type, and a different value. It tests the behavior of the IsFalseDimFilter when the EqualityFilter object has a different value.

## New input2:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("y", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with a different field name, but the same column type and value. It tests the behavior of the IsFalseDimFilter when the EqualityFilter object has a different field name.

## New input3:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.LONG, 123, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with the same field name, but a different column type and value. It tests the behavior of the IsFalseDimFilter when the EqualityFilter object has a different column type.

## New input4:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, null, null);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with the same field name and column type, but a different value (null). It tests the behavior of the IsFalseDimFilter when the EqualityFilter object has a different value (null).

## New input5:
```java
    EqualityFilter f3 = new EqualityFilter("x", ColumnType.STRING, "hello", "en");
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it creates a new EqualityFilter object with the same field name, column type, and value, but a different context. It tests the behavior of the IsFalseDimFilter when the EqualityFilter object has a different context.
