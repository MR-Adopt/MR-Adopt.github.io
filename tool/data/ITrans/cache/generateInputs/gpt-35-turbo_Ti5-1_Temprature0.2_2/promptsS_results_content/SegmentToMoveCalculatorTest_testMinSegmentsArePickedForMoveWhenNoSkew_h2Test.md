## New input1:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 0;
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where there are no segments in the tier. It is a valid input as it covers the edge case where there are no segments to be moved.

## New input2:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 1;
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where there is only one segment in the tier. It is a valid input as it covers the case where there is minimal data to be moved.

## New input3:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = 100_000;
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where there are a large number of segments in the tier. It is a valid input as it covers the case where there is a significant amount of data to be moved.

## New input4:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where the total number of segments in the tier is at the maximum value allowed by the `int` data type. It is a valid input as it covers the case where the number of segments is at the upper limit.

## New input5:
```java
    int totalSegmentsInTier = -1;
```
Explanation: This input tests the scenario where the total number of segments in the tier is negative. It is a valid input as it covers the case where the input is invalid and should be handled appropriately by the method under test.
