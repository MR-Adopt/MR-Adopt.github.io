## New input1:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new SequentialUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a different implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `SequentialUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it provides a different algorithm for generating UUIDs compared to the `RandomUuidGenerator` used in the original test case.

## New input2:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new CustomUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a custom implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `CustomUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it allows for testing a specific custom logic or algorithm for generating UUIDs.

## New input3:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new TimeBasedUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses another different implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `TimeBasedUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it generates UUIDs based on the current timestamp, providing a different approach to generating UUIDs compared to the `RandomUuidGenerator` used in the original test case.

## New input4:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new SecureRandomUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a different implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `SecureRandomUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it generates UUIDs using a secure random number generator, which can be useful for testing scenarios where security is a concern.

## New input5:
```java
    UuidGenerator generator = new MockUuidGenerator();
```
Explanation: This input uses a mock implementation of the `UuidGenerator` interface called `MockUuidGenerator`. It is valid because it allows for testing specific scenarios or edge cases by providing predetermined UUID values, which can be useful for testing specific behaviors in the code that uses UUIDs.
