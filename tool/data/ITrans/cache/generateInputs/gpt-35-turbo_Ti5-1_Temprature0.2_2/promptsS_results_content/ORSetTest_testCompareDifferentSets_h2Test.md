## New input1:
```java
    String element1 = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of adding an empty string to the set. It is important to ensure that the program handles empty strings correctly.

## New input2:
```java
    String element1 = "C";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of adding a different element to the set. It is important to verify that the program correctly adds elements other than "A" to the set.

## New input3:
```java
    String element1 = null;
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of adding a null element to the set. It is important to ensure that the program handles null elements correctly.

## New input4:
```java
    String element1 = "A";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of adding the same element "A" to the set again. It is important to verify that the program correctly handles duplicate elements.

## New input5:
```java
    String element1 = "AB";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of adding a string with multiple characters to the set. It is important to ensure that the program correctly handles strings with more than one character.
