## New input1:
```java
    Integer v01 = 0;
```
Explanation: This input tests the case where `v01` is set to the minimum possible value, which is 0. This is a valid input as it tests the program's ability to handle the edge case of the smallest possible value.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer v01 = -1001;
```
Explanation: This input tests the case where `v01` is set to a negative value. This is a valid input as it tests the program's ability to handle negative values.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer v01 = 999999;
```
Explanation: This input tests the case where `v01` is set to a large positive value. This is a valid input as it tests the program's ability to handle large values.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer v01 = null;
```
Explanation: This input tests the case where `v01` is set to null. This is a valid input as it tests the program's ability to handle null values.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer v01 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
```
Explanation: This input tests the case where `v01` is set to the maximum possible value for an Integer. This is a valid input as it tests the program's ability to handle the edge case of the largest possible value.
