## New input1:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(1, 1);
original.set(0, 0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input creates a 1x1 matrix with a single element set to 0. It is valid because it tests the case where the matrix has only one element.

## New input2:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(3, 3);
for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        original.set(i, j, i + j);
    }
}
```
Explanation: This input creates a 3x3 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. It is valid because it tests the case where the matrix has more than one row and column.

## New input3:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(2, 4);
for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        original.set(i, j, i + j);
    }
}
```
Explanation: This input creates a 2x4 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. It is valid because it tests the case where the matrix has more columns than rows.

## New input4:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(4, 2);
for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        original.set(i, j, i + j);
    }
}
```
Explanation: This input creates a 4x2 matrix with elements set to the sum of their row and column indices. It is valid because it tests the case where the matrix has more rows than columns.

## New input5:
```java
Primitive64Store original = Primitive64Store.FACTORY.make(0, 0);
```
Explanation: This input creates an empty matrix with 0 rows and 0 columns. It is valid because it tests the case where the matrix is empty.
