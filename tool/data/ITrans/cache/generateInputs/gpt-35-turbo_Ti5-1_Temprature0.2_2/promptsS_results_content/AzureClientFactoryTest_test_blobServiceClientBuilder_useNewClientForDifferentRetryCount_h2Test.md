## New input1:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 0;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to 0, indicating that no retries should be performed.

## New input2:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 3;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to a positive value, indicating the number of retries to be performed.

## New input3:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = -1;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to a negative value. Although it may not be a common scenario, it is important to handle such cases gracefully.

## New input4:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "account";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `retryCount` is set to the maximum possible value for an `Integer`. This tests the upper limit of the retry count.

## New input5:
```java
    Integer retryCount1 = 5;
    String ACCOUNT1 = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the scenario where the `ACCOUNT1` is an empty string. It is important to handle such cases where the storage account name is not provided correctly.
