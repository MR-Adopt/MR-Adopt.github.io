## New input1:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when an empty string is used as the key.

## New input2:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = null;
    String key = "key";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when a null value is used as the nextNameState.

## New input3:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key2";
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when a different key is used to retrieve the nextNameState.

## New input4:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when the same key and nextNameState are added again to the nameState.

## New input5:
```java
    NameState nextNameState = new NameState();
    String key = "key";
    nameState.addNextNameState(key, nextNameState);
    nameState.removeNextNameState(key);
```
Explanation: This input is valid because it tests the behavior of the program when the added nextNameState is removed from the nameState.
