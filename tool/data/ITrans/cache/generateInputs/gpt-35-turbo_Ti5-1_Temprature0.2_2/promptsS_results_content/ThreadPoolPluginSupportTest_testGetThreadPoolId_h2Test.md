## New input1:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 1, 1, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 1, which means it will have only one thread in the pool. This is a valid input to test the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when there is only one thread in the pool.

## New input2:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 10, 20, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size of 10 and a maximum pool size of 20. It also uses an `ArrayBlockingQueue` with a capacity of 10 as the work queue. This is a valid input to test the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when the pool size and work queue capacity are larger.

## New input3:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 0, 0, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 0, which means it will not create any threads in the pool. This is a valid input to test the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when there are no threads in the pool.

## New input4:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 5. It uses a `LinkedBlockingQueue` with an unbounded capacity as the work queue. This is a valid input to test the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when an unbounded work queue is used.

## New input5:
```java
ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor("test", manager, 5, 5, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<>(), Thread::new, new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
```
Explanation: This input creates an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size and maximum pool size of 5. It uses a `SynchronousQueue` as the work queue, which means it will not store any tasks and will always require a thread to be available to execute a task. This is a valid input to test the behavior of the `getThreadPoolId()` method when a synchronous work queue is used.
