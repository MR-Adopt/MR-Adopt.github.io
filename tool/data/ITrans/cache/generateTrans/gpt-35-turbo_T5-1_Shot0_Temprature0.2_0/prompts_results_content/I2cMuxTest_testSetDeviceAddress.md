Based on the provided information, it seems that the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is as follows:

- The 'SOURCE INPUT' is an instance of the `I2cMux` class, created using the `Runtime.start()` method.
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is also an instance of the `I2cMux` class, created using the same `Runtime.start()` method.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply create a new instance of the `I2cMux` class using the same parameters passed to the `Runtime.start()` method.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class I2cMuxTest_testSetDeviceAddress {
    public static I2cMux inputTransformation_testSetDeviceAddress(I2cMux i2cMux, String deviceAddress) {
        I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
        return i2cMux2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case as well as for the additional input pairs.
