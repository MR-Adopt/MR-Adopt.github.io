The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is obtained by creating a new instance of the 'FieldDefinition' class with the same name and type as the 'SOURCE INPUT', but with the 'deprecated' flag set to true.

Based on this relationship, we can generate the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class FieldDefinitionTest_testEqualsAndHashCode {
    public static FieldDefinition inputTransformation_testEqualsAndHashCode(FieldDefinition subject)  {
        FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition(subject.getName(), subject.getType()).deprecate();
        return other3;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a 'FieldDefinition' object as the 'SOURCE INPUT' and creates a new 'FieldDefinition' object with the same name and type, but with the 'deprecated' flag set to true. The resulting object is returned as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, including boundary values.
