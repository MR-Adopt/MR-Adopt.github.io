Based on the provided test case, it can be deduced that the transformation function should create a new instance of `YearHalf` using the `of` method with the same `year` value and a different `half` value.

To generate the transformation function, you can use the following code:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_isLeapYear_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_isLeapYear_int(int year, Half half)  {
        int year2 = year;
        int halfValue = (half.getValue() == 1) ? 2 : 1;
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year2, halfValue);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

In this transformation function, the `year` value remains the same, while the `half` value is transformed to its complement. If the original `half` value is 1, the transformed `half` value is set to 2, and vice versa.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the `year` value remains the same and the `half` value is transformed to its complement.
