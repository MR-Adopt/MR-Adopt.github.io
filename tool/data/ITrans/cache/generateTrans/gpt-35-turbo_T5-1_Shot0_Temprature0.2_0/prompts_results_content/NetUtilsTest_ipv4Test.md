Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the `ipv4ToLong` method converts an IP address string into a long value, while the `longToIpv4` method converts a long value into an IP address string.

The relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` in the test case is that the `ipStr1` is converted to a long value using the `ipv4ToLong` method, and then the `ipLong2` is converted back to an IP address string using the `longToIpv4` method.

To create the transformation function, we can simply call the `ipv4ToLong` method with the `SOURCE INPUT` and return the result as the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`.

Here's the generated transformation function for the provided test case:

```java
public class NetUtilsTest_ipv4Test {
    public static long inputTransformation_ipv4Test(String ipStr1)  {
        long ipLong2 = NetUtils.ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
        return ipLong2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` for the provided input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
