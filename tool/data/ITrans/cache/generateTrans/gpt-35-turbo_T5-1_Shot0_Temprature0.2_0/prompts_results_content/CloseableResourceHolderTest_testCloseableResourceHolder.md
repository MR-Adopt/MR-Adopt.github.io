Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `fromCloseable` method is used to create a `ResourceHolder` object from a `Closeable` resource. The `ResourceHolder` object is then compared with another `ResourceHolder` object (`holder2`) created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` constructor.

From this observation, we can deduce that the transformation function should simply create a `ResourceHolder` object using the `fromCloseable` method from the provided `Closeable` resource.

Here is the generated transformation function:

```java
public class CloseableResourceHolderTest_testCloseableResourceHolder {
    public static ResourceHolder<Closeable> inputTransformation_testCloseableResourceHolder(Closeable closeable)  {
        ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
        return holder2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a `Closeable` object as input and returns a `ResourceHolder` object created using the `fromCloseable` method. It can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
