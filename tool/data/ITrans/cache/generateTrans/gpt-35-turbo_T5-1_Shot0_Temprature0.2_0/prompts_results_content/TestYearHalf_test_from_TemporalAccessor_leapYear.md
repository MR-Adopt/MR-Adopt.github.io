The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

- The 'year' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'year' in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
- The 'expected' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is calculated based on the 'date' in the 'SOURCE INPUT'. It is obtained by dividing the month value of the 'date' minus 1 by 6 and adding 1.

Based on this relationship, the transformation function can be generated as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_from_TemporalAccessor_leapYear {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_from_TemporalAccessor_leapYear(LocalDate date)  {
        int year = date.getYear();
        int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year, expected);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a 'date' as input and transforms it into the corresponding 'year' and 'expected' values. The 'year' is obtained directly from the 'date' using the `getYear()` method. The 'expected' is calculated by subtracting 1 from the month value of the 'date', dividing it by 6, and adding 1.

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
