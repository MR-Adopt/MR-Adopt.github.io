The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is created by instantiating a new object of the same class as the 'SOURCE INPUT' and passing the same argument to the constructor.

Based on this relationship, the transformation function can be generated as follows:

```java
public class HybridJacksonPoolTest_testVirtualThreadPoolWithSingleThread {
    public static HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool inputTransformation_testVirtualThreadPoolWithSingleThread(HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool)  {
        HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(virtualPool.getCapacity());
        return virtualPool2;
    }
}
```

The transformation function takes a 'SOURCE INPUT' of type `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` and returns a 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' of the same type. It creates a new object of the same class as the 'SOURCE INPUT' and sets the capacity of the new object to be the same as the capacity of the 'SOURCE INPUT'. This ensures that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is created with the same configuration as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
