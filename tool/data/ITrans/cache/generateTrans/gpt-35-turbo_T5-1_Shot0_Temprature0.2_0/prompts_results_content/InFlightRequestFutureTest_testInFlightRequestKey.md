Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class returns the same value for different instances of the class if the `group` attribute is the same.

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`, we need to create a new instance of `InFlightRequestKey` with the same `group` value as the `SOURCE INPUT`, but different values for the `int` attributes.

Here is the updated transformation function:

```java
public class InFlightRequestFutureTest_testInFlightRequestKey {
    public static InFlightRequestKey inputTransformation_testInFlightRequestKey(InFlightRequestKey requestKey1)  {
        String group = requestKey1.getGroup();
        int newInt1 = requestKey1.getInt1() + 1;
        int newInt2 = requestKey1.getInt2() + 1;
        InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey(group, newInt1, newInt2);
        return requestKey2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function increments the values of `int1` and `int2` attributes by 1 and creates a new instance of `InFlightRequestKey` with the same `group` value as the `SOURCE INPUT` and the updated `int` attributes.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the `group` attribute is the same and the `int` attributes need to be incremented by 1.
