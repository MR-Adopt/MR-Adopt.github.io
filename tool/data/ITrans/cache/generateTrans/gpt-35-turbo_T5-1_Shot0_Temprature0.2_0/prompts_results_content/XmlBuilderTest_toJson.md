Based on the provided code and test case, it can be deduced that the `parse` method in the `XmlBuilder` class is responsible for converting an XML string into an `XmlBuilder` object. The `toJson` method in the `XmlBuilder` class is responsible for converting the `XmlBuilder` object into a JSON string.

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` (XML string) into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` (XmlBuilder object), we can use the `parse` method. Therefore, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class XmlBuilderTest_toJson {
    public static XmlBuilder inputTransformation_toJson(String XML)  {
        return XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes an XML string as input and returns the corresponding XmlBuilder object by calling the `parse` method.

The deduced relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is that the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is obtained by parsing the `SOURCE INPUT` using the `parse` method.
