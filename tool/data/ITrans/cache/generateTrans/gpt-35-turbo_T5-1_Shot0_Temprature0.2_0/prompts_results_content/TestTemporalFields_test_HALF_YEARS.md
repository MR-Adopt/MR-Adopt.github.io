The given test case compares the result of `YearQuarter.of(year1, quarter1)` with the result of `HALF_YEARS.addTo(YearQuarter.of(year2, quarter2), amount)`. 

From the test case, we can deduce the following metamorphic relation:

- If we add `amount` half-years to a `YearQuarter` (`year2`, `quarter2`), the resulting `YearQuarter` should be equal to `YearQuarter.of(year1, quarter1)`.

Based on this relation, we can create a transformation function that takes `year1` and `quarter1` as input and generates the corresponding `year2`, `quarter2`, and `amount` as output.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class TestTemporalFields_test_HALF_YEARS {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_HALF_YEARS(int year1, int quarter1)  {
        int year2 = year1;
        int quarter2 = quarter1 - 2;
        int amount = 1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year2, quarter2, amount);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

In this transformation function, we set `year2` to be the same as `year1`, `quarter2` to be `quarter1 - 2`, and `amount` to be 1. This transformation ensures that when we add `amount` half-years to `YearQuarter.of(year2, quarter2)`, we get the same result as `YearQuarter.of(year1, quarter1)`.

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
