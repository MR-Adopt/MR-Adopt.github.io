Based on the provided test case, we can deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' as follows:

The 'SOURCE INPUT' is an instance of the `Class` class, representing the type of elements in a list. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is an instance of the `TypeLiteral` class, representing the same list type but with additional information about the type.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we need to create a new instance of `TypeLiteral` using the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the argument for the `listOf` method. This will create a `TypeLiteral` object that represents the list type with the specified element type.

Here's the updated transformation function:

```java
public class TypeLiteralTest_normalize {
    public static TypeLiteral inputTransformation_normalize(Class input)  {
        return TypeLiteral.listOf(input);
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a 'SOURCE INPUT' of type `Class` and returns a 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' of type `TypeLiteral`. It uses the `listOf` method from the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' to create a `TypeLiteral` object representing the list type with the specified element type.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'SOURCE INPUT' is an instance of the `Class` class representing the type of elements in a list.
