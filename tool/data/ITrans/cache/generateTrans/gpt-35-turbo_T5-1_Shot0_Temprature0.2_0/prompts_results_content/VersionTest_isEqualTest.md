Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the follow-up input `v2` is obtained by incrementing the minor version number of the source input `v1` by 1. 

To generate the transformation function, we can split the source input `v1` into major and minor version numbers using the dot separator. Then, we increment the minor version number by 1 and concatenate it with the major version number to form the follow-up input `v2`.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class VersionTest_isEqualTest {
    public static String inputTransformation_isEqualTest(String version)  {
        String[] vs = version.split("\\.");
        int major = Integer.parseInt(vs[0]);
        int minor = Integer.parseInt(vs[1]);
        minor++;
        return major + "." + minor;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the follow-up input is obtained by incrementing the minor version number of the source input by 1.
