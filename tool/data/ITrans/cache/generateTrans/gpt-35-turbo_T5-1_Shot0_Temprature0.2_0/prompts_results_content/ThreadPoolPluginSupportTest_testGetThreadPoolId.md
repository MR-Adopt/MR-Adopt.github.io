The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`executor`) and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`support`) in the test case is that the `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object is created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` value.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`executor`) into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`support`), we need to create a new `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` value.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class ThreadPoolPluginSupportTest_testGetThreadPoolId {
    public static ThreadPoolPluginSupport inputTransformation_testGetThreadPoolId(ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor)  {
        ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new ThreadPoolPluginSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
        return support;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object as input and creates a new `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` value. The `executor` object is passed as a parameter to the `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` constructor, along with the `manager` object (which is not provided in the test case).

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they involve an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object and require creating a `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` value.
