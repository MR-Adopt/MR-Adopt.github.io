The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that both 'version' and 'version1' are instances of the 'Version' class created using the 'valueOf' method.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply call the 'valueOf' method of the 'Version' class with the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the input parameter.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class VersionTest_stringOfTest {
    public static Version inputTransformation_stringOfTest(String version)  {
        Version version1 = Version.valueOf(version);
        return version1;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and any other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
