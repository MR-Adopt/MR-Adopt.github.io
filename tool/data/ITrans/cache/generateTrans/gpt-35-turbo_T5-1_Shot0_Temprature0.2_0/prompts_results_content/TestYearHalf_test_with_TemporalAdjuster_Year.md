Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The follow-up input `year3` is equal to the source input `year2`.
2. The follow-up input `half3` is equal to the source input `half1`.

To transform the source input into the follow-up input, we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_with_TemporalAdjuster_Year {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_with_TemporalAdjuster_Year(int year1, int half1, int year2) {
        int year3 = year2;
        int half3 = half1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the source input `year1`, `half1`, and `year2` as parameters and returns a list containing the transformed follow-up input `year3` and `half3`. The function simply assigns `year2` to `year3` and `half1` to `half3`.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
