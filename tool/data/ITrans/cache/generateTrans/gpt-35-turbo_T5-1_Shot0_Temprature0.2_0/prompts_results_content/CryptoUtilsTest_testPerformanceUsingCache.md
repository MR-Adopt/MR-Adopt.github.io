Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `value` is being encrypted using the `encrypt` method and then decrypted using the `decrypt` method. The encrypted value is stored in the `message` variable and the class of the decrypted value is stored in the `clazz` variable.

Therefore, the relationship between the `value` and the `message` can be deduced as follows:
- The `value` is encrypted to obtain the `message`.

Similarly, the relationship between the `value` and the `clazz` can be deduced as follows:
- The `value` is decrypted using the `clazz` to obtain the decrypted value.

Based on these relationships, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class CryptoUtilsTest_testPerformanceUsingCache {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testPerformanceUsingCache(Long value)  {
        String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
        Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(message, clazz);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the `value` as input and returns a list containing the transformed `message` and `clazz` values. The `value` is encrypted using the `encrypt` method to obtain the `message`, and the `clazz` is set to `Long.class`.

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
