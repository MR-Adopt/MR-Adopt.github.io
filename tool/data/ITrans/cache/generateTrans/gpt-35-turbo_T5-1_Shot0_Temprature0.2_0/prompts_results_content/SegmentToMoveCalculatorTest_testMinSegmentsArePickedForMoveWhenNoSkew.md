To deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case, let's analyze the code and the provided test case.

In the 'computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier' method, the 'totalSegmentsInTier' is divided by 2^16 (~65k segments) and multiplied by 100 to increase the value in steps of 100. The result is stored in the 'upperBound' variable.

In the 'computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier' method, the 'totalSegments' is calculated by summing up the 'getTotalSegmentCount()' values of all 'ServerHolder' objects in the 'historicals' list. Then, the 'computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier' method is called with 'totalSegments' as the argument to get the 'minSegmentsToMove' value.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the following relationship:

- 'totalSegmentsInTier' is used to calculate the 'upperBound' in the 'computeMinSegmentsToMoveInTier' method.
- 'totalSegmentsInTier' is also used to calculate the 'minSegmentsToMove' in the 'computeNumSegmentsToMoveInTier' method.

Therefore, the transformation function should take 'totalSegmentsInTier' as the 'SOURCE INPUT' and generate 'tier', 'historicals', and 'maxSegmentsToMoveInTier' as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest_testMinSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenNoSkew {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testMinSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenNoSkew(int totalSegmentsInTier) {
        String tier = "tier1";
        List<ServerHolder> historicals = Arrays.asList(createServer("A", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS), createServer("B", SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest.WIKI_SEGMENTS));
        int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(tier, historicals, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function sets the 'tier' to a fixed value "tier1", creates a list of 'ServerHolder' objects with fixed values, and sets 'maxSegmentsToMoveInTier' to the maximum possible value.

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics by simply passing different values for 'totalSegmentsInTier'.
