Based on the provided test case and the given program under test, the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`original`) and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`shifted2`) can be deduced as follows:

The 'SOURCE INPUT' (`original`) is a matrix of size `r` x `c` where `r` and `c` are the number of rows and columns respectively. The elements of the matrix are set such that each element at position (`i`, `j`) is equal to the sum of `i` and `j`.

The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`shifted2`) is obtained by applying the `shift` function to the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`original`). The `shift` function rearranges the elements of the matrix by shifting the first and second halves of the rows and columns. This puts the zero-frequency term in the middle and the conjugate pairs at equal distances from the center.

To generate the transformation function, you can create a new method called `inputTransformation_testShiftAndRevertEven` in the `DiscreteFourierTransformTest_testShiftAndRevertEven` class. This method takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`original`) as a parameter and returns the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`shifted2`).

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class DiscreteFourierTransformTest_testShiftAndRevertEven {
    public static MatrixStore<Double> inputTransformation_testShiftAndRevertEven(Primitive64Store original)  {
        MatrixStore<Double> shifted2 = DiscreteFourierTransform.shift(original);
        return shifted2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
