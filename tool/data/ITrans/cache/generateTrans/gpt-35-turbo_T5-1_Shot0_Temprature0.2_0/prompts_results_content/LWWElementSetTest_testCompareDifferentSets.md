Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it seems that the transformation function should transform the `key` attribute of the `Element` object from `element1` to `element2`, while keeping the `bias` attribute the same.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class LWWElementSetTest_testCompareDifferentSets {
    public static Element inputTransformation_testCompareDifferentSets(Element element1)  {
        String key = "key2";
        int bias = element1.bias;
        Element element2 = new Element(key, bias);
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This function takes an `Element` object `element1` as input and creates a new `Element` object `element2` with the `key` attribute set to `"key2"` and the `bias` attribute set to the same value as `element1.bias`. The transformed `element2` is then returned.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics by simply calling the function with the appropriate `element1` object.
