Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`year` and `half`) and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`text`) in the test case. It appears that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is formed by concatenating the `year` and `half` values with a hyphen in between.

To create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply concatenate the `year` and `half` values with a hyphen in between.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_parse_CharSequence {
    public static CharSequence inputTransformation_test_parse_CharSequence(int year, int half)  {
        CharSequence text = year + "-H" + half;
        return text;
    }
}
```

This transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
