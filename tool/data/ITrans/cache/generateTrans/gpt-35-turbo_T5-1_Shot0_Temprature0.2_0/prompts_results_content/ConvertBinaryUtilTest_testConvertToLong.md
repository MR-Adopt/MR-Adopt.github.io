Based on the provided code and test case, we can deduce that the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is as follows:

- The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a string that needs to be converted to a byte array.
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the byte array representation of the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create a function that converts the string into a byte array using the UTF-8 encoding. Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class ConvertBinaryUtilTest_testConvertToLong {
    public static byte[] inputTransformation_testConvertToLong(String randomString)  {
        return randomString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    }
}
```

This transformation function uses the `getBytes` method of the `String` class to convert the string into a byte array using the UTF-8 encoding. The resulting byte array is then returned as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'SOURCE INPUT' is a string and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the byte array representation of that string.
