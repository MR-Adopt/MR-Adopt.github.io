Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'year' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT' is used to create an instance of the 'YearHalf' class.
2. The 'half' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT' is used to create an instance of the 'Half' enum.
3. The 'year' value in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'year' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
4. The 'half' value in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is always set to 1.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_lengthOfYear {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_lengthOfYear(int year, Half half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, 1);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns a new instance of 'YearHalf' with the same 'year' value and 'half' value set to 1. This function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other input pairs with similar characteristics.
