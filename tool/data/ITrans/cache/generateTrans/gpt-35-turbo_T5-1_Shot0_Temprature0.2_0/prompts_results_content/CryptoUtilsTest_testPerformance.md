Based on the provided information, it seems that the transformation function for the test case is as follows:

```java
public class CryptoUtilsTest_testPerformance {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testPerformance(Long value)  {
        String message = CryptoUtils.encrypt(value);
        Class<?> clazz = Long.class;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(message, clazz);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

The transformation function takes a `Long` value as input and encrypts it using the `CryptoUtils.encrypt()` method. The encrypted value is then assigned to the `message` variable. The `clazz` variable is set to `Long.class`. Finally, the transformed inputs, consisting of the `message` and `clazz` variables, are returned as a list.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
