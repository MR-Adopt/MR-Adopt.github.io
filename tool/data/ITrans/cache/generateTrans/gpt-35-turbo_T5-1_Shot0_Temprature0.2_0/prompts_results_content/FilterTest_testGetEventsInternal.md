Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation from the source input `filter` to the follow-up input `filter2` involves creating a new instance of the `Filter` class and adding the same events as the source input.

The transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class FilterTest_testGetEventsInternal {
    public static Filter inputTransformation_testGetEventsInternal(Filter filter)  {
        Filter filter2 = new Filter();
        for (Filter.FilterEvent event : filter.getEventsInternal()) {
            filter2.add(event);
        }
        return filter2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of the `Filter` class, iterates over the events in the source input's internal events list, and adds each event to the follow-up input's internal events list.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the `Filter` class and its `add` method remain unchanged.
