The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that they are both instances of the `UuidGenerator` class. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is created by instantiating a new `UuidGenerator` object.

To generate the transformation function, we can create a method named `inputTransformation_generates_different_non_null_uuids` that takes a `UuidGenerator` object as input and returns a new instance of `UuidGenerator`. This method will create a new `UuidGenerator` object and return it.

Here's the updated code skeleton with the transformation function:

```java
public class RandomUuidGeneratorTest_generates_different_non_null_uuids {
    public static UuidGenerator inputTransformation_generates_different_non_null_uuids(UuidGenerator generator)  {
        UuidGenerator generator2 = new RandomUuidGenerator();
        return generator2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
