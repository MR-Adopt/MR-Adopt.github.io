The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is obtained by incrementing the value of the 'SOURCE INPUT' by 1.

To create the transformation function, we can define a method `inputTransformation_testHashCodeAndEquals` in the `CostTest_testHashCodeAndEquals` class. This method takes a `Cost` object as input and returns a new `Cost` object with the value incremented by 1.

Here's the updated code skeleton with the transformation function:

```java
public class CostTest_testHashCodeAndEquals {
    public static Cost inputTransformation_testHashCodeAndEquals(Cost subject)  {
        int newValue = subject.getValue() + 1;
        Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(newValue);
        return other;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided 'SOURCE INPUT' and also for other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
