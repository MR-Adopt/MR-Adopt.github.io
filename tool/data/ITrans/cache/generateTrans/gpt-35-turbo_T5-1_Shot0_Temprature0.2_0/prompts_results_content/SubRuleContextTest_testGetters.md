The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. The 'generator2' object is created as a new instance of the 'SubRuleContext.Generator' class.
2. The 'generator2' object calls the 'generate' method with the input parameter "name".
3. The 'id' variable is assigned the value -1.7976931348623157E308.
4. The 'getNameForGeneratedId' method is called on the 'generator2' object with the 'id' as the input parameter.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class SubRuleContextTest_testGetters {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testGetters(SubRuleContext.Generator generator, String NAME)  {
        SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
        Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(generator2, id);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of the 'SubRuleContext.Generator' class and assigns it to the 'generator2' variable. It also assigns the value -1.7976931348623157E308 to the 'id' variable. The transformed inputs are then returned as a list.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics by calling the function with the appropriate 'SOURCE INPUT' values.
