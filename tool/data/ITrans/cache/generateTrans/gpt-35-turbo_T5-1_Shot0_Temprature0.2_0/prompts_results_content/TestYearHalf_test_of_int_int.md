Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

- The 'year' and 'half' values in the 'SOURCE INPUT' are used to create a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.
- The 'test2' variable is assigned the result of calling the 'of' method with the 'year' and 'half' values from the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
- The 'test2' variable is then returned as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Based on this relationship, we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_of_int_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_of_int_int(int year, int half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns the 'test2' variable, which represents the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. The function creates a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method with the provided 'year' and 'half' values, and assigns the result to the 'test2' variable. Finally, the 'test2' variable is returned as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they follow the same relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
