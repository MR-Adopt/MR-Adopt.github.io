Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it seems that the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that they have the same key and value, but potentially different bias.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create a function that takes an 'Element' object as input and returns a new 'Element' object with the same key and value as the input, but potentially different bias.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case and input pairs:

```java
public class LWWElementSetTest_testRemove {
    public static Element inputTransformation_testRemove(Element element)  {
        Element element2 = new Element(element.key, element.value, element.bias);
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new 'Element' object with the same key, value, and bias as the input 'Element' object.

The deduced relation and generated transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' remains the same.
