Based on the provided code and test case, it can be deduced that the transformation function converts the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' as follows:

1. The 'jw' object of type JsonWriter is used to serialize the 'lts' array of type LocalTime[].
2. The serialized JSON is stored in the 'body' byte array.
3. The size of the serialized JSON is stored in the 'size' variable.
4. The 'manifest' variable is set to the type of the deserialized object, which is LocalTime[] in this case.

To create the transformation function, you can use the following code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import com.dslplatform.json.JsonWriter;

public class DateTest_localTimeBoundary {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_localTimeBoundary(JsonWriter jw, LocalTime[] lts) {
        byte[] body = jw.getByteBuffer();
        int size = jw.size();
        Class<LocalTime[]> manifest = LocalTime[].class;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(manifest, body, size);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This function takes the 'jw' object and 'lts' array as input and returns a list containing the transformed 'manifest', 'body', and 'size' values. The 'manifest' is set to LocalTime[].class, 'body' is obtained from the JsonWriter using the getByteBuffer() method, and 'size' is obtained using the size() method.

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and handle other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
