The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' consists of an instance of the `IntArrayList` class named `a` and a boolean variable named `trimFlag`.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' consists of a modified instance of the `IntArrayList` class named `a2` and a boolean variable named `trimFlag2`.
3. The modification in `a2` is performed by appending the same values as in `a` using the `appendValue` method.
4. The modification in `trimFlag2` is performed by setting it to the opposite value of `trimFlag`.

Based on this relationship, the transformation function can be generated as follows:

```java
public class ArrayListTest_extract {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_extract(IntArrayList a, boolean trimFlag) {
        IntArrayList a2 = new IntArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
            a2.appendValue(a.get(i));
        }
        boolean trimFlag2 = !trimFlag;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(a2, trimFlag2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes an instance of `IntArrayList` and a boolean variable as input and returns a list containing the modified `IntArrayList` instance (`a2`) and the modified boolean variable (`trimFlag2`). The function appends the values from `a` to `a2` using the `appendValue` method and sets `trimFlag2` to the opposite value of `trimFlag`.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform the provided 'OTHER INPUT PAIRS' and any other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
