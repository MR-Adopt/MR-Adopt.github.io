The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

- The 'symptom2' object is assigned the reference of the 'symptom' object, making them point to the same memory location.
- The 'module2' variable is assigned the same value as the 'module' variable.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class ExpressedSymptomTest_testExpressedSymtpom {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testExpressedSymtpom(ExpressedSymptom symptom, String module)  {
        ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
        String module2 = module;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(symptom2, module2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
