Based on the provided information, it seems that the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`ap`) and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`type`) is that the value of `type` is obtained from the `activityType` property of the `ap` object.

To generate the transformation function, you can use the following code:

```java
public class ScoringConfigGroupTest_testAddActivityParams {
    public static String inputTransformation_testAddActivityParams(ActivityParams ap)  {
        String type = ap.getActivityType();
        return type;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes an `ActivityParams` object as input and returns the value of its `activityType` property. It can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`ap`) into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`type`) for the provided test case and any other input pairs with similar characteristics.
