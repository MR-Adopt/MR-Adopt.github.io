Based on the provided information, the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that they are both instances of the `EqualityFilter` class with the same field name, column type, and value.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create a function `inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey` that takes an `EqualityFilter` object as input and returns a new `EqualityFilter` object with the same field name, column type, and value.

Here's the updated code skeleton with the transformation function:

```java
public class IsBooleanDimFilterTest_testGetCacheKey {
    public static EqualityFilter inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey(EqualityFilter f3)  {
        EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter(f3.getField(), f3.getColumnType(), f3.getValue(), null);
        return f4;
    }
}
```

The transformation function `inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey` creates a new `EqualityFilter` object `f4` with the same field name, column type, and value as the input `f3`. The `null` value for the fourth argument is assumed to be the default value for that argument.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they are instances of the `EqualityFilter` class and have the same field name, column type, and value.

Please note that the transformation function assumes that the `EqualityFilter` class has a constructor that takes the field name, column type, value, and an additional argument (which is set to `null` in this case). If the actual constructor or class structure is different, the transformation function may need to be adjusted accordingly.
