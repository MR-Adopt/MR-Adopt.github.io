Based on the provided code and test case, we can deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' as follows:

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' is an instance of `PhysicalStore<Double>` named 'input'.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is an instance of `MatrixStore<ComplexNumber>` named 'transformed2'.
3. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is created by calling the `transform` method of the 'transformer' object with the 'input' as the argument.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class DiscreteFourierTransformTest_testNonPowerOf2 {
    public static MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> inputTransformation_testNonPowerOf2(DiscreteFourierTransform transformer, PhysicalStore<Double> input)  {
        MatrixStore<ComplexNumber> transformed2 = transformer.transform(input);
        return transformed2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a 'DiscreteFourierTransform' object and a 'PhysicalStore<Double>' object as input and returns a 'MatrixStore<ComplexNumber>' object. It applies the 'transform' method of the 'transformer' object to the 'input' and returns the result.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they follow the same relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
