The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that they are always the same class. In other words, the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is equal to the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

To create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply return the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Here's the updated code skeleton with the transformation function:

```java
public class KeyTest_equals {
    public static Class<?> inputTransformation_equals(Class<?> type1)  {
        Class<?> type2 = type1;
        return type2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function will work for the provided test case as well as for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' are always the same class.
