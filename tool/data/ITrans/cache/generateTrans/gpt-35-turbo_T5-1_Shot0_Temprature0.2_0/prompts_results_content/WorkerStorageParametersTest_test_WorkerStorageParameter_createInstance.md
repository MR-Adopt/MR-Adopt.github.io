Based on the provided test case and the code under test, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input (`l`) and the follow-up inputs (`l2`, `b`):

1. The value of `l2` is derived from `l` by multiplying it with a factor of 2.25.
2. The value of `b` is always `true`.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the source input (`l`) into the follow-up inputs (`l2`, `b`):

```java
public class WorkerStorageParametersTest_test_WorkerStorageParameter_createInstance {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_WorkerStorageParameter_createInstance(long l)  {
        long l2 = (long) (l * 2.25);
        boolean b = true;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(l2, b);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate follow-up inputs for the given source input (`l`), as well as for other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
