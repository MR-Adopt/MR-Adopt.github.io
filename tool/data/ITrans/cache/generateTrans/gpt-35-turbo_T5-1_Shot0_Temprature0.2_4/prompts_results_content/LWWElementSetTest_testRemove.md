Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it seems that the transformation function should create a new `Element` object with the same key, value, and bias as the source input `element`, but with a different reference.

Therefore, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class LWWElementSetTest_testRemove {
    public static Element inputTransformation_testRemove(Element element)  {
        Element element2 = new Element(element.key, element.value, element.bias);
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new `Element` object using the same key, value, and bias as the source input `element`. This ensures that the follow-up input `element2` has the same characteristics as the source input, but with a different reference.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the follow-up inputs.
