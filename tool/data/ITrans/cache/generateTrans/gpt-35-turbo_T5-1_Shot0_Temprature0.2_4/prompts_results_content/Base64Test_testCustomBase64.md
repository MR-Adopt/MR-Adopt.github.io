Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the `encode` method in the `Base64` class is used to encode a byte array into a Base64 encoded string, and the `decode` method is used to decode a Base64 encoded string into a byte array.

The relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` in the test case is that the `testDataBytes` byte array is encoded using the `encode` method to generate the `encoded` string, and then the `input2` string is decoded using the `decode` method to generate the `decoded` byte array.

To create the transformation function, we need to reverse the process. We need to create a function that takes a byte array as input and returns a Base64 encoded string. This can be achieved by calling the `encode` method on the input byte array.

Here's the transformation function for the provided test case:

```java
public class Base64Test_testCustomBase64 {
    public static String inputTransformation_testCustomBase64(byte[] testDataBytes)  {
        return Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the corresponding `FOLLOW UP INPUT` values.
