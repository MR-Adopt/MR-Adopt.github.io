The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a new instance of the same class as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply create a new instance of the same class as the 'SOURCE INPUT' with the same constructor arguments.

Here is the generated transformation function:

```java
public class HybridJacksonPoolTest_testVirtualThreadPoolWithSingleThread {
    public static HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool inputTransformation_testVirtualThreadPoolWithSingleThread(HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool)  {
        HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(virtualPool.getPoolSize());
        return virtualPool2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a 'SOURCE INPUT' of type `HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool` and creates a new instance of the same class with the same pool size as the 'SOURCE INPUT'. The new instance is then returned as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics by calling the constructor of the 'SOURCE INPUT' class with the appropriate arguments.
