Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class returns the same value for two objects if their `group` attribute is the same, regardless of the values of the `int` attributes `int1` and `int2`.

Therefore, the relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` in the test case is that the `group` attribute remains the same while the values of `int1` and `int2` are different.

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`, we need to create a new `InFlightRequestKey` object with the same `group` attribute as the `SOURCE INPUT` and different values for `int1` and `int2`.

Here's the updated transformation function:

```java
public class InFlightRequestFutureTest_testInFlightRequestKey {
    public static InFlightRequestKey inputTransformation_testInFlightRequestKey(InFlightRequestKey requestKey1)  {
        InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey(requestKey1.getGroup(), 1, 1);
        return requestKey2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new `InFlightRequestKey` object with the same `group` attribute as the `SOURCE INPUT` and sets the values of `int1` and `int2` to `1`.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the `group` attribute remains the same and the values of `int1` and `int2` need to be different.
