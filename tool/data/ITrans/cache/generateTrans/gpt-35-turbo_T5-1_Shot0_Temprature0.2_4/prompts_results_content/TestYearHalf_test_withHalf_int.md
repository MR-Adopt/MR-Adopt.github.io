Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The year remains the same in both the source input and the follow-up input.
2. The half value in the follow-up input is the same as the half value in the source input, except when the half value in the source input is 2. In that case, the half value in the follow-up input is 1.

Based on this relationship, we can create a transformation function that converts the source input into the follow-up input:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_withHalf_int {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_withHalf_int(int year1, int half1, int half2) {
        int year3 = year1;
        int half3 = (half1 == 2) ? 1 : half1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the source input `year1`, `half1`, and `half2` as parameters and returns a list containing the transformed follow-up input `year3` and `half3`. The `year3` remains the same as `year1`, and the `half3` is equal to `half1` unless `half1` is 2, in which case `half3` is set to 1.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
