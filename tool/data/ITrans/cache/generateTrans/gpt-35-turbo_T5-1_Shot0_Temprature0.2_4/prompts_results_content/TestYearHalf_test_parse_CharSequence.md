Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (year and half) and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (text) as follows:

- The 'text' is formed by concatenating the 'year' and 'half' values with a hyphen in between.
- The 'year' value is converted to a string representation.
- The 'half' value is converted to a string representation and prefixed with 'H'.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' (year and half) into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (text) as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_parse_CharSequence {
    public static CharSequence inputTransformation_test_parse_CharSequence(int year, int half)  {
        CharSequence text = year + "-H" + half;
        return text;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
