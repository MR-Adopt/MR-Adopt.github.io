Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a string that is encoded using the `Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe` algorithm.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the expected encoded string for the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can use the following transformation function:

```java
public class Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafeTest_testAllNonSurrogateCodePoints {
    public static String inputTransformation_testAllNonSurrogateCodePoints(String input) {
        String encoded2 = Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe.encode(input);
        return encoded2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function simply calls the `encode` method of the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe` class to encode the 'SOURCE INPUT' and returns the encoded string as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

This transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'SOURCE INPUT' is a string that needs to be encoded using the `Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe` algorithm.
