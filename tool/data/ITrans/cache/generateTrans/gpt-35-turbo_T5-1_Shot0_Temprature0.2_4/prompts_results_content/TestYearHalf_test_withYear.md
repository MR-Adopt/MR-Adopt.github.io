Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The follow-up input `year3` is equal to the source input `year2`.
2. The follow-up input `half3` is equal to the source input `half1`.

To generate the transformation function, we can use the deduced relationship to transform the source input into the follow-up input. Here's the completed code skeleton:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_withYear {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_withYear(int year1, int half1, int year2)  {
        int year3 = year2;
        int half3 = half1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the follow-up input for the provided test case as well as other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
