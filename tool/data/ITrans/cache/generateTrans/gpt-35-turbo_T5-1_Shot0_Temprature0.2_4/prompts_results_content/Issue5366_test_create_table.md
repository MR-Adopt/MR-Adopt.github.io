The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is obtained by removing unnecessary spaces and aligning the comma (',') and the opening and closing parentheses ('(', ')') in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

To create the transformation function, you can use the following code:

```java
public class Issue5366_test_create_table {
    public static String inputTransformation_test_create_table(String sql)  {
        // Remove unnecessary spaces
        sql = sql.replaceAll("\\s+", " ");
        
        // Align comma (',')
        sql = sql.replaceAll(",\\s*", ", ");
        
        // Align opening and closing parentheses ('(', ')')
        sql = sql.replaceAll("\\(\\s*", "(");
        sql = sql.replaceAll("\\s*\\)", ")");
        
        return sql;
    }
}
```

This transformation function will remove unnecessary spaces, align the comma (',') with a space after it, and align the opening and closing parentheses ('(', ')') with no spaces before or after them.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case, as well as other input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
