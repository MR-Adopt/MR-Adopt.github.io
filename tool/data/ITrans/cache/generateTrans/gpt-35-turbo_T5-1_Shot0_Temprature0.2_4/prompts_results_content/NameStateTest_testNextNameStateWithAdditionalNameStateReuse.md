The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

- The value of 'key2' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the value of 'key' in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
- The value of 'nameState2' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the value of 'nameState' in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' as follows:

```java
public class NameStateTest_testNextNameStateWithAdditionalNameStateReuse {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testNextNameStateWithAdditionalNameStateReuse(String key, NameState nextNameState) {
        String key2 = key;
        NameState nameState2 = nameState;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(key2, nameState2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided 'SOURCE INPUT' and also for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
