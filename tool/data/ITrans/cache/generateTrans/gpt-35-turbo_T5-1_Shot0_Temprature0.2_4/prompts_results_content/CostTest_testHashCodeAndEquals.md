The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is obtained by incrementing the value of the 'SOURCE INPUT' by 1.

To create the transformation function, we can define a method `inputTransformation_testHashCodeAndEquals` in the `CostTest_testHashCodeAndEquals` class that takes a `Cost` object as input and returns a new `Cost` object with the value incremented by 1.

Here's the updated code skeleton in the 'OUTPUT FORMAT':

```java
public class CostTest_testHashCodeAndEquals {
    public static Cost inputTransformation_testHashCodeAndEquals(Cost subject)  {
        int newValue = subject.getValue() + 1;
        Cost other = Cost.costOfSeconds(newValue);
        return other;
    }
}
```

The `inputTransformation_testHashCodeAndEquals` method takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' `subject` and retrieves its value using the `getValue` method. It then increments the value by 1 and creates a new `Cost` object `other` using the `costOfSeconds` method with the incremented value. Finally, it returns the `other` object as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics by passing the 'SOURCE INPUT' to the `inputTransformation_testHashCodeAndEquals` method and obtaining the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
