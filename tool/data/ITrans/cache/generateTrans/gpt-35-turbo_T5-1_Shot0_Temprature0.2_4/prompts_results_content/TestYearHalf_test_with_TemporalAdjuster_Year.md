Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and follow-up input:

1. The year of the follow-up input (`year3`) is always equal to the year of the source input (`year1`).
2. The half of the follow-up input (`half3`) is always equal to the half of the source input (`half1`).

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_with_TemporalAdjuster_Year {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_with_TemporalAdjuster_Year(int year1, int half1, int year2) {
        int year3 = year1;
        int half3 = half1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the source input (`year1`, `half1`, `year2`) and returns the follow-up input (`year3`, `half3`) based on the deduced relationship. The year of the follow-up input is set to the year of the source input, and the half of the follow-up input is set to the half of the source input. This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
