Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `parse` method is used to convert an XML string into an `XmlBuilder` object. The `toXml` method is then called on the `XmlBuilder` object to convert it back into an XML string.

From the test case, we can deduce that the relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` (XML string) and the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` (XmlBuilder object) is that the `parse` method is used to convert the XML string into an `XmlBuilder` object.

To generate the transformation function, we can create a method named `inputTransformation_toXml` that takes an XML string as input and returns an `XmlBuilder` object. This method will internally call the `parse` method to perform the conversion.

Here's the updated code skeleton in the `OUTPUT FORMAT`:

```java
public class XmlBuilderTest_toXml {
    public static XmlBuilder inputTransformation_toXml(String XML)  {
        return XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to convert any XML string into an `XmlBuilder` object, similar to the provided test case.
