Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it seems that the transformation function is generating a new `Element` object with a different key but the same bias value as the source input. The key of the follow-up input is always "key2".

Therefore, the deduced relationship between the source input (`element1`) and the follow-up input (`element2`) is that the key of the follow-up input is always "key2", and the bias value remains the same as the source input.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class LWWElementSetTest_testCompareDifferentSets {
    public static Element inputTransformation_testCompareDifferentSets(Element element1)  {
        Element element2 = new Element("key2", element1.bias, bias);
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the follow-up input for the provided test case as well as for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
