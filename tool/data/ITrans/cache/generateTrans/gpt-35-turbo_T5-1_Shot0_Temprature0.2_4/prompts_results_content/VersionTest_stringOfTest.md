Based on the provided test case, it can be deduced that the transformation function converts a string representation of a version number into a Version object.

To create the transformation function, we can use the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class to convert the string into a `Version` object.

Here is the updated code skeleton for the transformation function:

```java
public class VersionTest_stringOfTest {
    public static Version inputTransformation_stringOfTest(String version)  {
        Version version1 = Version.valueOf(version);
        return version1;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a string `version` as input and returns a `Version` object. It uses the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class to convert the string into a `Version` object.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, such as converting a string representation of a version number into a `Version` object.
