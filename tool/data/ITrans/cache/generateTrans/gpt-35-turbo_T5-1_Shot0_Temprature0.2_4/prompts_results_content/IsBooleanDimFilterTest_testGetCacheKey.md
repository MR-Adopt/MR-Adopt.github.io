Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation function `of` in the `IsFalseDimFilter` class simply creates a new instance of `IsFalseDimFilter` with the same field as the input `DimFilter`.

Therefore, the relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is that they have the same field value.

To generate the transformation function, we can create a method named `inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey` in the class `IsBooleanDimFilterTest_testGetCacheKey` that takes an `EqualityFilter` object as input and returns a new `EqualityFilter` object with the same field value.

Here's the updated code skeleton:

```java
public class IsBooleanDimFilterTest_testGetCacheKey {
    public static EqualityFilter inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey(EqualityFilter f3)  {
        EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter(f3.getField(), f3.getType(), f3.getValue(), f3.getExtractionFn());
        return f4;
    }
}
```

The `inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey` method takes an `EqualityFilter` object `f3` as input and creates a new `EqualityFilter` object `f4` with the same field, type, value, and extraction function as `f3`. The `f4` object is then returned as the transformed input.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the transformation is simply creating a new instance of the same class with the same field value.
