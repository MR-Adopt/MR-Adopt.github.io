Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the relationship between 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case as follows:

- The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a version string in the format "x.y" where x and y are integers representing the major and minor version numbers respectively.
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a version string in the same format "x.y" but with a higher minor version number than the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can increment the minor version number by 1 while keeping the major version number the same.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class VersionTest_isHigherThanTest {
    public static String inputTransformation_isHigherThanTest(String version)  {
        String[] parts = version.split("\\.");
        int major = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int minor = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
        minor++; // Increment the minor version number by 1
        return major + "." + minor;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case as well as other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
