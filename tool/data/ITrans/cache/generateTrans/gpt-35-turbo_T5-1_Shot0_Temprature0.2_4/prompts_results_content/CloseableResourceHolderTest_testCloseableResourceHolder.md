Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `fromCloseable` method takes a `Closeable` object as input and returns a `ResourceHolder` object. The `ResourceHolder` object is created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` class.

The `ResourceHolder` class has a method `get()` which returns the `Closeable` object stored in the `ResourceHolder` object.

From the test case, it can be deduced that the transformation function should create a new `ResourceHolder` object using the `Closeable` object as input and return it.

Here is the updated transformation function:

```java
public class CloseableResourceHolderTest_testCloseableResourceHolder {
    public static ResourceHolder<Closeable> inputTransformation_testCloseableResourceHolder(Closeable closeable)  {
        ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
        return holder2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a `Closeable` object as input and returns a `ResourceHolder` object created using the `fromCloseable` method.
