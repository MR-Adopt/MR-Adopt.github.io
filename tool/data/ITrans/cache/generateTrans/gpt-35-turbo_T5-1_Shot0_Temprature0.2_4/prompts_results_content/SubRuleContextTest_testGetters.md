Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `generator2` object is created as a new instance of `SubRuleContext.Generator` class. The `generate` method is then called on this new instance with the input `"name"`. The `id` is assigned the value `-1.7976931348623157E308`.

Therefore, the relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` can be deduced as follows:
- The `generator2` object is created as a new instance of `SubRuleContext.Generator` class.
- The `generate` method is called on `generator2` with the input `"name"`.
- The `id` is assigned the value `-1.7976931348623157E308`.

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`, we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class SubRuleContextTest_testGetters {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testGetters(SubRuleContext.Generator generator, String NAME)  {
        SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
        Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(generator2, id);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of `SubRuleContext.Generator` class and assigns it to `generator2`. It also assigns the value `-1.7976931348623157E308` to `id`. The transformed inputs are then returned as a list.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
