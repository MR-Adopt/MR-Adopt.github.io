Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

- The 'year' and 'half' values in the 'SOURCE INPUT' are used to create a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.
- The 'year' and 'half' values in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' are used to create another instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.

Therefore, the transformation function can be created as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_of_int_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_of_int_int(int year, int half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class created using the 'of' method with the same 'year' and 'half' values. This function can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other input pairs with similar characteristics.
