Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`ipStr1`) is the IP address in string format, and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`ipLong2`) is the corresponding IP address in long format.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can use the `ipv4ToLong` method from the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' to convert the IP address string into a long value.

Here is the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class NetUtilsTest_ipv4Test {
    public static long inputTransformation_ipv4Test(String ipStr1)  {
        long ipLong2 = NetUtils.ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
        return ipLong2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`ipStr1`) as a parameter and uses the `ipv4ToLong` method to convert it into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`ipLong2`). The transformed value is then returned.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they are valid IP addresses in string format.
