Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'year' value remains the same in both the source input and follow-up input.
2. The 'half' value is always set to 1 in the follow-up input.

Based on this relationship, we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_lengthOfYear {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_lengthOfYear(int year, Half half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, 1);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and creates a new YearHalf object with the same 'year' value and 'half' value set to 1. This function can be used to generate the follow-up input for the provided test case as well as for other input pairs with similar characteristics.
