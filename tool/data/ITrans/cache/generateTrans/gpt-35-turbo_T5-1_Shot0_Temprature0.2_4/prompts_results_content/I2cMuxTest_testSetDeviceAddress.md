The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

- The 'SOURCE INPUT' is an instance of the class 'I2cMux' created using the 'Runtime.start' method with the name "i2cMux" and the class "I2cMux".
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is also an instance of the class 'I2cMux' created using the 'Runtime.start' method with the name "i2cMux" and the class "I2cMux".

Based on this relationship, the transformation function can be created as follows:

```java
public class I2cMuxTest_testSetDeviceAddress {
    public static I2cMux inputTransformation_testSetDeviceAddress(I2cMux i2cMux, String deviceAddress)  {
        I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
        return i2cMux2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of the 'I2cMux' class using the 'Runtime.start' method with the same name and class as the 'SOURCE INPUT'. This ensures that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a new instance of the 'I2cMux' class, separate from the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as it consistently creates a new instance of the 'I2cMux' class with the same name and class as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
