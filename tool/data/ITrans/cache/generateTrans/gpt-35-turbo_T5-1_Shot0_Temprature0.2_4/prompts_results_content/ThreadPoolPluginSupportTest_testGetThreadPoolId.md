Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`support`) is created using the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`executor`) in the following way:

1. The `executor` is used to create a new instance of `TestSupport` by passing the `executor.getThreadPoolId()`, `executor`, and `manager` as arguments.

Based on this observation, we can create a transformation function that takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`executor`) as a parameter and returns the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`support`) as the output.

Here is the transformation function:

```java
public class ThreadPoolPluginSupportTest_testGetThreadPoolId {
    public static ThreadPoolPluginSupport inputTransformation_testGetThreadPoolId(ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor)  {
        return new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes an instance of `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` as input and returns a new instance of `TestSupport` created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()`, `executor`, and `manager`.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
