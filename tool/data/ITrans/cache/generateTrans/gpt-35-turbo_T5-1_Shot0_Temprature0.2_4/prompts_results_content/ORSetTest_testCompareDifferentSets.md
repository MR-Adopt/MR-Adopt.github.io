Based on the provided information, it seems that the `add` method in the `ORSet` class adds an element to the set. The `element` parameter represents the element to be added.

In the given test case, the `ORSet` objects `orSet1` and `orSet2` are created, and two different elements, `element1` and `element2`, are added to them respectively using the `add` method. The test case then checks if `orSet1` and `orSet2` are not equal using the `compare` method.

From the provided input pairs, we can observe that the `SOURCE INPUT` (`element1`) and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` (`element2`) are different elements that are added to different `ORSet` objects.

Based on this observation, we can deduce that the transformation function should simply return the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` as it is. There is no specific transformation or relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` in this case.

Therefore, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class ORSetTest_testCompareDifferentSets {
    public static String inputTransformation_testCompareDifferentSets(String element1)  {
        return element2;
    }
}
```

Please note that the `element2` variable needs to be defined and assigned the appropriate value before returning it.
