The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'year' and 'half' values from the 'SOURCE INPUT' are used to create a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method. The resulting 'YearHalf' object is then used to obtain the 'isLeapYear' value, which is compared to the expected value.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can directly use the 'YearHalf.of' method with the same 'year' and 'half' values. This will create a new 'YearHalf' object that represents the same year and half-of-year.

Here is the transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_isLeapYear_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_isLeapYear_int(int year, Half half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the given 'SOURCE INPUT' and can also be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
