Based on the provided information, it seems that the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is that the value of the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the activity type obtained from the 'SOURCE INPUT' object.

To create the transformation function, you can use the following code:

```java
public class ScoringConfigGroupTest_testAddActivityParams {
    public static String inputTransformation_testAddActivityParams(ActivityParams ap)  {
        String type = ap.getActivityType();
        return type;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes an 'ActivityParams' object as input and returns the activity type obtained from that object. It can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
