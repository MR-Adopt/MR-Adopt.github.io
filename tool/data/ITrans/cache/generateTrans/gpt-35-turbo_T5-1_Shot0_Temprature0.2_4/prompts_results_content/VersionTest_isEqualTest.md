Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

- The 'SOURCE INPUT' is in the format of a version number with a major version and a minor version separated by a dot.
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is also in the format of a version number with a major version and a minor version separated by a dot.
- The major version in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the major version in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
- The minor version in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is greater than the minor version in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

Based on this relationship, we can create a transformation function that increments the minor version in the 'SOURCE INPUT' to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. Here's the code for the transformation function:

```java
public class VersionTest_isEqualTest {
    public static String inputTransformation_isEqualTest(String version)  {
        String[] vs = version.split("\\.");
        int major = Integer.parseInt(vs[0]);
        int minor = Integer.parseInt(vs[1]);
        minor++; // Increment the minor version
        return major + "." + minor;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
