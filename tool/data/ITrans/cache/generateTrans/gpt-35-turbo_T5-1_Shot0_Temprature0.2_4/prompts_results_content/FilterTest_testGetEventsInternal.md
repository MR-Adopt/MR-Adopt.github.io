Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation function `inputTransformation_testGetEventsInternal` adds the same events to the `filter2` object as the events added to the `filter` object. 

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`, we can iterate over the events in the `filter` object and add them to the `filter2` object.

Here's the updated transformation function:

```java
public class FilterTest_testGetEventsInternal {
    public static Filter inputTransformation_testGetEventsInternal(Filter filter)  {
        Filter filter2 = new Filter();
        for (Filter.FilterEvent event : filter.getEventsInternal()) {
            filter2.add(event);
        }
        return filter2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function iterates over the events in the `filter` object using the `getEventsInternal` method and adds each event to the `filter2` object using the `add` method.

This transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the `filter` and `filter2` objects have the same methods and behavior.
