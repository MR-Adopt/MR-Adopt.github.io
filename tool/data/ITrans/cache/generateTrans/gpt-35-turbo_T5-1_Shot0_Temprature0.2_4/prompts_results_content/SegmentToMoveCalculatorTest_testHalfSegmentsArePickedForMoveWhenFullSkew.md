Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The 'tier' value remains the same in both the source input and the follow-up input.
2. The 'historicals' list remains the same in both the source input and the follow-up input.
3. The 'maxSegmentsToMoveInTier' value remains the same in both the source input and the follow-up input.

Based on this relationship, we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest_testHalfSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenFullSkew {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testHalfSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenFullSkew(String tier, List<ServerHolder> historicals)  {
        String tier2 = tier;
        List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = historicals;
        int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(tier2, historicals2, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'tier' and 'historicals' from the source input and returns a follow-up input with the same values for 'tier' and 'historicals'. The 'maxSegmentsToMoveInTier' value is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE in the follow-up input.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as it maintains the same values for 'tier' and 'historicals' and sets 'maxSegmentsToMoveInTier' to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
