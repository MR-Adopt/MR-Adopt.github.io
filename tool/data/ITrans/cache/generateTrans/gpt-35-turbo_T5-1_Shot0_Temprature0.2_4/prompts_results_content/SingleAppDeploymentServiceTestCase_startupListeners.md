The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT'. 

To create a function that transforms 'SOURCE INPUT' into 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply return the 'SOURCE INPUT' itself.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class SingleAppDeploymentServiceTestCase_startupListeners {
    public static StartupListener inputTransformation_startupListeners(StartupListener startUpListener1)  {
        return startUpListener1;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is expected to be the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
