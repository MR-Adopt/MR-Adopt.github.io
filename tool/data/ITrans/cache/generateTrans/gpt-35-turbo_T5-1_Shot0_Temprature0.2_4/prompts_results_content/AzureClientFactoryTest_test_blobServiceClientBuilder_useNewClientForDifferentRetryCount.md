Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The `retryCount1` value in the source input is used to determine the `retryCount2` value in the follow-up input.
   - If `retryCount1` is `null`, then `retryCount2` is set to `1`.
   - If `retryCount1` is not `null`, then `retryCount2` is set to the same value as `retryCount1`.

2. The `ACCOUNT1` value in the source input is used to determine the `ACCOUNT2` value in the follow-up input.
   - The `ACCOUNT2` value is set to the same value as `ACCOUNT1`.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class AzureClientFactoryTest_test_blobServiceClientBuilder_useNewClientForDifferentRetryCount {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_blobServiceClientBuilder_useNewClientForDifferentRetryCount(Integer retryCount1, String ACCOUNT1)  {
        Integer retryCount2 = retryCount1 != null ? retryCount1 : 1;
        String ACCOUNT2 = ACCOUNT1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(retryCount2, ACCOUNT2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the `retryCount1` and `ACCOUNT1` values as input and returns a list containing the transformed `retryCount2` and `ACCOUNT2` values. The function follows the deduced relationship to determine the values for the follow-up input.
