The given test case involves the `of` method of the `YearQuarter` class. The method takes two parameters, `year` and `quarter`, and returns a `YearQuarter` object.

From the test case, we can observe that the `YearQuarter.of` method is called twice with different values for `year` and `quarter`. The first call is made with `year1` and `quarter1`, and the second call is made with `year2` and `quarter2`.

The `addTo` method is also called on the `YearQuarter` object returned by the second `YearQuarter.of` method call. It takes an `amount` parameter and returns a new `YearQuarter` object.

Based on the test case, we can deduce that the transformation function should transform the `year1` and `quarter1` values into `year2` and `quarter2` values. The `amount` value should remain the same.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class TestTemporalFields_test_HALF_YEARS {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_HALF_YEARS(int year1, int quarter1)  {
        int year2 = year1;
        int quarter2 = quarter1;
        int amount = 1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year2, quarter2, amount);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function assumes that the `year` and `quarter` values are directly mapped from `year1` and `quarter1` to `year2` and `quarter2`. The `amount` value remains the same.

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
