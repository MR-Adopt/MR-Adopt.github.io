Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the `encode` method in the `Base64` class is used to encode a byte array into a Base64 encoded string, and the `decode` method is used to decode a Base64 encoded string into a byte array.

The relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` in the test case is that the `testDataBytes` byte array is encoded using the `encode` method to generate the `encoded` string, and then the `input2` string is decoded using the `decode` method to generate the `decoded` byte array. Therefore, the transformation function should encode the `SOURCE INPUT` byte array to generate the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` string.

Here is the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class Base64Test_testCustomBase64 {
    public static String inputTransformation_testCustomBase64(byte[] testDataBytes) {
        return Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a byte array `testDataBytes` as input and returns the Base64 encoded string generated by the `encode` method.

The deduced relation and generated transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the input pairs follow the same encoding and decoding process using the `encode` and `decode` methods.
