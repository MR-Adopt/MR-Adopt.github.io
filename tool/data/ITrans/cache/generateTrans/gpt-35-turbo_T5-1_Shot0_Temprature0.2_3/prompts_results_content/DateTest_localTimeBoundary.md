The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. `jw` is an instance of `JsonWriter` used for serializing JSON.
2. `lts` is an array of `LocalTime` objects.
3. `manifest` is a `Class` object representing the type `LocalTime[]`.
4. `body` is a byte array representing the serialized JSON.
5. `size` is an integer representing the size of the serialized JSON.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function `inputTransformation_localTimeBoundary` that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' as follows:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class DateTest_localTimeBoundary {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_localTimeBoundary(JsonWriter jw, LocalTime[] lts) {
        Class<LocalTime[]> manifest = LocalTime[].class;
        byte[] body = jw.getByteBuffer();
        int size = jw.size();
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(manifest, body, size);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes `jw` and `lts` as input and returns a list containing the transformed values of `manifest`, `body`, and `size`. The transformed values are obtained by directly accessing the corresponding properties of the `JsonWriter` object.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
