Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and follow-up input:

1. The year in the follow-up input (`year3`) is the same as the year in the source input (`year1`).
2. The half in the follow-up input (`half3`) is the same as the half in the source input (`half1`).

Based on this relationship, we can create a transformation function that takes the source input (`year1`, `half1`, `year2`) and returns the follow-up input (`year3`, `half3`).

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_with_TemporalAdjuster_Year {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_with_TemporalAdjuster_Year(int year1, int half1, int year2) {
        int year3 = year1;
        int half3 = half1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function simply assigns the values of `year1` and `half1` to `year3` and `half3`, respectively.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform the source input into the follow-up input for the provided test case as well as for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
