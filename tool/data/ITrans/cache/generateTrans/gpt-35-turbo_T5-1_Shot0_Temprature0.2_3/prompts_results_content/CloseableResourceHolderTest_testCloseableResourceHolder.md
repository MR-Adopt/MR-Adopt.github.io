Based on the provided test case, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

The 'SOURCE INPUT' is an instance of the `Closeable` interface, which is passed as an argument to the `fromCloseable` method. This method creates a new instance of `CloseableResourceHolder` and returns it as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

To create the transformation function, we need to define a method that takes a `Closeable` object as input and returns a `ResourceHolder<Closeable>` object. The method should perform the same steps as the `fromCloseable` method in the test case.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class CloseableResourceHolderTest_testCloseableResourceHolder {
    public static ResourceHolder<Closeable> inputTransformation_testCloseableResourceHolder(Closeable closeable)  {
        return ResourceHolder.fromCloseable(closeable);
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`holder2`) from any 'SOURCE INPUT' (`closeable`) that is an instance of the `Closeable` interface.
