Based on the provided information, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input (`i2cMux`, `deviceAddress`) and the follow-up input (`i2cMux2`):

1. The `i2cMux` object is created using the `Runtime.start` method with the parameters `"i2cMux"` and `"I2cMux"`.
2. The `deviceAddress` is set on the `i2cMux` object using the `setDeviceAddress` method.
3. The `i2cMux2` object is created using the same `Runtime.start` method with the same parameters as `i2cMux`.

Based on this relationship, we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class I2cMuxTest_testSetDeviceAddress {
    public static I2cMux inputTransformation_testSetDeviceAddress(I2cMux i2cMux, String deviceAddress)  {
        I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
        i2cMux2.setDeviceAddress(deviceAddress);
        return i2cMux2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new `i2cMux2` object using the same `Runtime.start` method as `i2cMux`. It then sets the `deviceAddress` on the `i2cMux2` object using the `setDeviceAddress` method. Finally, it returns the `i2cMux2` object.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as it follows the same steps to create the `i2cMux2` object and set the `deviceAddress`.
