Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `parse` method is used to convert an XML string into an `XmlBuilder` object. The `toXml` method is then called on the `XmlBuilder` object to convert it back into an XML string.

The relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` (XML string) and the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` (XmlBuilder object) is that the `parse` method is used to create the `XmlBuilder` object from the XML string. Therefore, the transformation function should involve calling the `parse` method on the XML string to obtain the `XmlBuilder` object.

Here is the transformation function:

```java
public class XmlBuilderTest_toXml {
    public static XmlBuilder inputTransformation_toXml(String XML)  {
        XmlBuilder xmlBuilder = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
        return xmlBuilder;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the `XML` string as input and calls the `parse` method on it to obtain the corresponding `XmlBuilder` object. The `XmlBuilder` object is then returned as the transformed output.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the `SOURCE INPUT` is an XML string and the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is an `XmlBuilder` object created by calling the `parse` method on the XML string.
