The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that they are always the same class. Therefore, the transformation function should simply return the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Here is the generated transformation function:

```java
public class KeyTest_equals {
    public static Class<?> inputTransformation_equals(Class<?> type1)  {
        Class<?> type2 = type1;
        return type2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' are always the same class.
