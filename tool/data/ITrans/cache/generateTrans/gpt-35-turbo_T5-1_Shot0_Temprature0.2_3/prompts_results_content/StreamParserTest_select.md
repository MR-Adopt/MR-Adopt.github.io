The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT'. 

To create the transformation function, we can simply return the 'queryTitle' as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. 

Here is the generated transformation function:

```java
public class StreamParserTest_select {
    public static String inputTransformation_select(StreamParser parser, String queryTitle) throws IOException  {
        String queryTitle2 = queryTitle;
        return queryTitle2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case as well as for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
