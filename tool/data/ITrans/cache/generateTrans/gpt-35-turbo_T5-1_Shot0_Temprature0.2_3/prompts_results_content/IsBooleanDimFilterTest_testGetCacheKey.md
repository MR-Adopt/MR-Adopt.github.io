Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation function `inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey` should simply return the `SOURCE INPUT` as the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`. This is because the `IsFalseDimFilter.of` method simply creates a new `IsFalseDimFilter` object with the provided `field` parameter.

Here is the completed transformation function:

```java
public class IsBooleanDimFilterTest_testGetCacheKey {
    public static EqualityFilter inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey(EqualityFilter f3)  {
        EqualityFilter f4 = f3;
        return f4;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as it simply returns the `SOURCE INPUT` as the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`.
