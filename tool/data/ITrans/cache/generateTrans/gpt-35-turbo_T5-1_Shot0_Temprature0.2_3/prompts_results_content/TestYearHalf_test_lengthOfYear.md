Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'year' value remains the same in both the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
2. The 'half' value is always set to 1 in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Based on this relationship, we can create a transformation function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_lengthOfYear {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_lengthOfYear(int year, Half half)  {
        // Set the 'half' value to 1
        Half transformedHalf = Half.H1;
        
        // Create the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' using the transformed 'half' value
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, transformedHalf);
        
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the 'year' value remains the same and the 'half' value is set to 1 in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
