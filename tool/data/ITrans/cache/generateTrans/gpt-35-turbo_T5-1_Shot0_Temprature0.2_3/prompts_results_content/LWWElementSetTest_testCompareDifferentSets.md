Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it seems that the transformation function is generating the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' by changing the key of the 'SOURCE INPUT' element. The key of the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' element is always "key2".

Therefore, the transformation function can be written as follows:

```java
public class LWWElementSetTest_testCompareDifferentSets {
    public static Element inputTransformation_testCompareDifferentSets(Element element1)  {
        Element element2 = new Element("key2", element1.value, element1.bias);
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' element and creates a new element with the same value and bias, but with the key set to "key2". This function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
