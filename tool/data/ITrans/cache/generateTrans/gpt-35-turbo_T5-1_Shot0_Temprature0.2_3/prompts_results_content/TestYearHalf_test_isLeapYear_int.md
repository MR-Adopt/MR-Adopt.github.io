Based on the provided test case, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

- The 'year' and 'half' values from the 'SOURCE INPUT' are used to create a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.
- The 'year2' and 'halfValue' values from the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' are used to create another instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.
- The 'isLeapYear' method is called on the 'test2' object to determine if the year is a leap year.

Based on this relationship, we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_isLeapYear_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_isLeapYear_int(int year, Half half)  {
        return YearHalf.of(year, half);
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method. This function can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and potentially for other input pairs with similar characteristics.
