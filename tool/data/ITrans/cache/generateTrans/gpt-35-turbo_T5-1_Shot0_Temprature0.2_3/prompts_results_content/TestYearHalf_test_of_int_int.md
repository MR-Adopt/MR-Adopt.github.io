Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'year' and 'half' values in the 'SOURCE INPUT' are used to create a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.
2. The 'year' value in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'year' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
3. The 'half' value in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'half' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_of_int_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_of_int_int(int year, int half)  {
        return YearHalf.of(year, half);
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method with the same 'year' and 'half' values.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'year' and 'half' values are within the valid range specified in the 'of' method.
