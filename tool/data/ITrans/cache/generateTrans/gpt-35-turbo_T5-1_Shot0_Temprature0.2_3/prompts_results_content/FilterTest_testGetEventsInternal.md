Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be deduced that the transformation function should create a deep copy of the `Filter` object `filter` and assign it to `filter2`. The deep copy should include copying all the events from `filter` to `filter2`.

Here is the transformation function:

```java
public class FilterTest_testGetEventsInternal {
    public static Filter inputTransformation_testGetEventsInternal(Filter filter)  {
        Filter filter2 = new Filter();
        for (Filter.FilterEvent event : filter.getEventsInternal()) {
            filter2.add(event);
        }
        return filter2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new `Filter` object `filter2` and iterates over the events in `filter` using the `getEventsInternal()` method. It then adds each event to `filter2` using the `add()` method. Finally, it returns the transformed `filter2` object.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the corresponding `filter2` objects.
