Based on the provided code and test case, the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' can be deduced as follows:

The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a string, and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is an array of bytes representing the UTF-8 encoding of the string.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we need to convert the string into its corresponding UTF-8 byte representation.

Here is the transformation function:

```java
public class ConvertBinaryUtilTest_testConvertToLong {
    public static byte[] inputTransformation_testConvertToLong(String randomString) {
        return randomString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    }
}
```

This transformation function uses the `getBytes` method of the `String` class to convert the string into an array of bytes using the UTF-8 encoding.

The deduced relation and the generated transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, including boundary values.
