Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and follow-up input:

- The year in the follow-up input (`year3`) is always the same as the year in the source input (`year1`).
- The half in the follow-up input (`half3`) is always the same as the half in the source input (`half2`).

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_withHalf_int {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_withHalf_int(int year1, int half1, int half2) {
        int year3 = year1;
        int half3 = half2;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the source input (`year1`, `half1`, `half2`) and returns the follow-up input (`year3`, `half3`) based on the deduced relationship. The function simply assigns the value of `year1` to `year3` and the value of `half2` to `half3`.
