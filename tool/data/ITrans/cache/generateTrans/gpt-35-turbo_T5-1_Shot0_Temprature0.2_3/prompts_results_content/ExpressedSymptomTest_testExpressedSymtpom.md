The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. The 'symptom2' object is assigned the reference of the 'symptom' object, which means both objects point to the same memory location.
2. The 'module2' variable is assigned the same value as the 'module' variable.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class ExpressedSymptomTest_testExpressedSymtpom {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testExpressedSymtpom(ExpressedSymptom symptom, String module) {
        ExpressedSymptom symptom2 = symptom;
        String module2 = module;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(symptom2, module2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function assigns the 'symptom2' object the reference of the 'symptom' object, and the 'module2' variable is assigned the same value as the 'module' variable. The function returns a list containing the transformed 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' objects.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
