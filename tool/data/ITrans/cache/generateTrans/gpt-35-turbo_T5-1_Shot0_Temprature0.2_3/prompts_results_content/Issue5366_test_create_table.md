Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation function replaces occurrences of certain characters and strings in the 'SOURCE INPUT' to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. Specifically, the following transformations are applied:

1. Replace all occurrences of " ( " with "(".
2. Replace all occurrences of "( " with "(".
3. Replace all occurrences of " )" with ")".
4. Replace all occurrences of "\t" with " ".
5. Replace all occurrences of "\n" with " ".
6. Replace all occurrences of "\'" with "\"".
7. Replace all occurrences of "  " with " ".
8. Replace all occurrences of ", " with ",".
9. Replace all occurrences of " ," with ",".

Based on these observations, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class Issue5366_test_create_table {
    public static String inputTransformation_test_create_table(String sql)  {
        sql = sql.replace(" ( ", "(")
                .replace("( ", "(")
                .replace(" )", ")")
                .replace("\t", " ")
                .replace("\n", " ")
                .replace("\'", "\"")
                .replace("  ", " ")
                .replace(", ", ",")
                .replace(" ,", ",");
        return sql;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to the provided test case and other input pairs to generate the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' values. It should also be applicable to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
