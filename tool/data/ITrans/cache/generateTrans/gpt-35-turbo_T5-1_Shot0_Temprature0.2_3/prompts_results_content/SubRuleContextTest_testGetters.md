Based on the provided test case and the program under test, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The `generator2` object is created as a new instance of `SubRuleContext.Generator`.
2. The `generate` method is called on `generator2` with the input `"name"`.
3. The `getNameForGeneratedId` method is called on `generator2` with the input `id`.

To transform the source input into the follow-up input, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a new instance of `SubRuleContext.Generator` and assign it to the variable `generator2`.
2. Assign the value of `id` to the variable `id`.

Here's the updated transformation function:

```java
public class SubRuleContextTest_testGetters {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testGetters(SubRuleContext.Generator generator, String NAME)  {
        SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
        Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(generator2, id);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the follow-up input for the provided test case and any other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
