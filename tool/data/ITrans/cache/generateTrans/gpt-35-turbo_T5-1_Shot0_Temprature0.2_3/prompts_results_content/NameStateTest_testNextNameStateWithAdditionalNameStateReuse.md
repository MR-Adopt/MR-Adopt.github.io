The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. The value of 'key2' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the value of 'key' in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
2. The value of 'nameState2' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the value of 'nameState' in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

Based on this relationship, the transformation function can be generated as follows:

```java
public class NameStateTest_testNextNameStateWithAdditionalNameStateReuse {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testNextNameStateWithAdditionalNameStateReuse(String key, NameState nextNameState) {
        String key2 = key;
        NameState nameState2 = nameState;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(key2, nameState2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
