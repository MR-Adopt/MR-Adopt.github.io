The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the given test case is that both 'generator' and 'generator2' are instances of the 'UuidGenerator' class. 

To create a function that transforms 'SOURCE INPUT' into 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply create a new instance of the 'UuidGenerator' class and assign it to 'generator2'.

Here's the updated transformation function:

```java
public class RandomUuidGeneratorTest_generates_different_non_null_uuids {
    public static UuidGenerator inputTransformation_generates_different_non_null_uuids(UuidGenerator generator)  {
        UuidGenerator generator2 = new UuidGenerator();
        return generator2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they are instances of the 'UuidGenerator' class.
