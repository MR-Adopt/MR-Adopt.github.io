Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`year` and `half`) and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`text`) as follows:

- The `text` is formed by concatenating the `year` and `-h` with the `half` value.
- The `year` is converted to a string representation.
- The `half` is converted to a string representation.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function `inputTransformation_test_parse_CharSequence_caseInsensitive` that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`year` and `half`) into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`text`).

Here's the updated code:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_parse_CharSequence_caseInsensitive {
    public static CharSequence inputTransformation_test_parse_CharSequence_caseInsensitive(int year, int half) {
        CharSequence text = Integer.toString(year) + "-h" + Integer.toString(half);
        return text;
    }
}
```

This transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
