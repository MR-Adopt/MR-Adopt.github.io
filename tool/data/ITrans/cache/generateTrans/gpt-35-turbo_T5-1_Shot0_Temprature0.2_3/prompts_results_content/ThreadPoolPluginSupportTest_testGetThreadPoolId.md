The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is created using the 'SOURCE INPUT' as a parameter in the constructor of the `TestSupport` class.

To generate the transformation function, we can create a method named `inputTransformation_testGetThreadPoolId` that takes an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object as a parameter and returns a `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object. This method will create a new `TestSupport` object using the `getThreadPoolId()` method of the provided `executor` object.

Here is the generated transformation function:

```java
public class ThreadPoolPluginSupportTest_testGetThreadPoolId {
    public static ThreadPoolPluginSupport inputTransformation_testGetThreadPoolId(ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor) {
        ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
        return support;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case as well as for other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
