The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT', except that the 'deprecated' flag is set to true.

To generate the transformation function, we can create a new instance of the 'FieldDefinition' class with the same 'name' and 'type' as the 'SOURCE INPUT', but with the 'deprecated' flag set to true.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class FieldDefinitionTest_testEqualsAndHashCode {
    public static FieldDefinition inputTransformation_testEqualsAndHashCode(FieldDefinition subject)  {
        FieldDefinition other3 = new FieldDefinition(subject.getName(), subject.getType()).deprecate();
        return other3;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to the provided 'OTHER INPUT PAIRS' as well as other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
