Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce that the 'text' value is derived from the 'year' and 'half' values in the following format: "{year}-H{half}".

To transform the 'year' and 'half' values into the 'text' value, we can concatenate them with the appropriate format.

Here is the updated transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_parse_CharSequence {
    public static CharSequence inputTransformation_test_parse_CharSequence(int year, int half)  {
        CharSequence text = year + "-H" + half;
        return text;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns the corresponding 'text' value. It follows the deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the provided test case and can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
