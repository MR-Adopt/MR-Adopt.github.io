Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation from the source input `token1` to the follow-up input `token2` is simply a direct assignment. In other words, the value of `token2` is the same as the value of `token1`.

Therefore, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class JsonNodePathTest_equalsEquals {
    public static String inputTransformation_equalsEquals(String token1)  {
        String token2 = token1;
        return token2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as the relationship between the source input and follow-up input remains the same.
