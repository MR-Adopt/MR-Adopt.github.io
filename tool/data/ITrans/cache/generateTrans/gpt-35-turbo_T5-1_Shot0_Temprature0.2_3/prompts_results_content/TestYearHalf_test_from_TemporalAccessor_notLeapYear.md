The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

- The 'year' value in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'year' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
- The 'expected' value in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is calculated based on the 'date' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT'. It is determined by dividing the month value of the 'date' by 6, adding 1 to the result.

Based on this relationship, the transformation function can be generated as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_from_TemporalAccessor_notLeapYear {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_from_TemporalAccessor_notLeapYear(LocalDate date)  {
        int year = date.getYear();
        int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year, expected);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a 'date' of type LocalDate as the 'SOURCE INPUT' and transforms it into a list of 'year' and 'expected' values as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. The 'year' value is obtained directly from the 'date' object, and the 'expected' value is calculated using the provided formula.
