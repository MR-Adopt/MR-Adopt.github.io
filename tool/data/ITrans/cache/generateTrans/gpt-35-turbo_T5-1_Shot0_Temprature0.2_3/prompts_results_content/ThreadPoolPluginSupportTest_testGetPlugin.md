The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'pluginId' is derived from the 'plugin' object. It appears that the 'pluginId' is the name or identifier of the plugin.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' (plugin) into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (pluginId), we can use the 'getName()' method of the 'ThreadPoolPlugin' interface to obtain the name of the plugin.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class ThreadPoolPluginSupportTest_testGetPlugin {
    public static String inputTransformation_testGetPlugin(ThreadPoolPlugin plugin) {
        String pluginId = plugin.getName();
        return pluginId;
    }
}
```

This transformation function extracts the name of the plugin from the 'plugin' object and returns it as the 'pluginId'.
