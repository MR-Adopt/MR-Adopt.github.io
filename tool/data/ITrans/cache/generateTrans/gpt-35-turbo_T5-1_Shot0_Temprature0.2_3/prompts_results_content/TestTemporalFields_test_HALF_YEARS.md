Based on the provided test case, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The follow-up `year2` will be the same as the source `year1`.
2. The follow-up `quarter2` will be the result of subtracting the source `quarter1` by the `amount`.
3. The follow-up `amount` will be the same as the source `amount`.

Now, let's generate the transformation function:

```java
public class TestTemporalFields_test_HALF_YEARS {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_HALF_YEARS(int year1, int quarter1)  {
        int year2 = year1;
        int quarter2 = quarter1 - amount;
        int amount = 1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year2, quarter2, amount);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate follow-up inputs for the given source input pair (`year1`, `quarter1`) and can also be applied to other input pairs with similar characteristics.
