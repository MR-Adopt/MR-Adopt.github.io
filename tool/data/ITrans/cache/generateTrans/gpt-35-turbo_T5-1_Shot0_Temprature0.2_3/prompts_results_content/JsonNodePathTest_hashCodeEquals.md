Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation function should return a new `JsonNodePath` object with the same `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type` values as the source input, but with a different `parent` object.

To implement this transformation function, you can create a new `JsonNodePath` object with the same `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type` values as the source input, and set the `parent` object of the new `JsonNodePath` to be the same as the `parent` object of the source input.

Here's the implementation of the transformation function:

```java
public class JsonNodePathTest_hashCodeEquals {
    public static JsonNodePath inputTransformation_hashCodeEquals(JsonNodePath a1)  {
        JsonNodePath a2 = new JsonNodePath(a1.getPathSegment(), a1.getPathSegmentIndex(), a1.getType());
        a2.setParent(a1.getParent());
        return a2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new `JsonNodePath` object `a2` with the same `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type` values as `a1`. Then, it sets the `parent` object of `a2` to be the same as the `parent` object of `a1`. Finally, it returns `a2` as the transformed input.

This transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they follow the same pattern of having the same `pathSegment`, `pathSegmentIndex`, and `type` values, but different `parent` objects.
