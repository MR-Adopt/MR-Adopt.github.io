Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class returns the same value for different instances of the class as long as the `group` attribute is the same.

Therefore, the deduced relationship between the source input `requestKey1` and the follow-up input `requestKey2` is that they have the same `group` attribute value.

To transform the source input `requestKey1` into the follow-up input `requestKey2`, we can create a function `inputTransformation_testInFlightRequestKey` that takes `requestKey1` as input and creates a new `InFlightRequestKey` instance with the same `group` attribute value and different `sequenceNumber` and `requestNumber` attribute values.

Here's the updated code skeleton for the transformation function:

```java
public class InFlightRequestFutureTest_testInFlightRequestKey {
    public static InFlightRequestKey inputTransformation_testInFlightRequestKey(InFlightRequestKey requestKey1)  {
        String group = requestKey1.getGroup();
        int sequenceNumber = requestKey1.getSequenceNumber() + 1;
        int requestNumber = requestKey1.getRequestNumber() + 1;
        InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey(group, sequenceNumber, requestNumber);
        return requestKey2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the `group` attribute value remains the same and the `sequenceNumber` and `requestNumber` attribute values are incremented by 1.

Note: The transformation function assumes that the `InFlightRequestKey` class has appropriate getter methods for the `group`, `sequenceNumber`, and `requestNumber` attributes.
