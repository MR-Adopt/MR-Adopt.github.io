Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can observe the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The `tier` and `tier2` values remain the same in both the source and follow-up inputs.
2. The `historicals` and `historicals2` lists have the same elements in the same order.
3. The `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` value remains the same in both the source and follow-up inputs.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest_testHalfSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenFullSkew {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testHalfSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenFullSkew(String tier, List<ServerHolder> historicals) {
        String tier2 = tier;
        List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = historicals;
        int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(tier2, historicals2, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the `tier` and `historicals` as input and returns a list containing the transformed `tier2`, `historicals2`, and `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` values. The transformation function keeps the `tier` and `tier2` values the same, copies the `historicals` list to `historicals2`, and sets `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the relationship between the source and follow-up inputs remains the same.
