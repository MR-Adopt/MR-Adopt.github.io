The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that they are always the same class.

To create a function that transforms 'SOURCE INPUT' into 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply return the 'SOURCE INPUT' itself.

Here's the updated code skeleton:

```java
public class KeyTest_equals {
    public static Class<?> inputTransformation_equals(Class<?> type1)  {
        Class<?> type2 = type1;
        return type2;
    }
}
```
