Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

- The 'year' and 'half' values in the 'SOURCE INPUT' are used to create a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.
- The 'year' and 'half' values in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' are used to create another instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply create a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method with the 'year' and 'half' values from the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_of_int_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_of_int_int(int year, int half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other input pairs with similar characteristics.
