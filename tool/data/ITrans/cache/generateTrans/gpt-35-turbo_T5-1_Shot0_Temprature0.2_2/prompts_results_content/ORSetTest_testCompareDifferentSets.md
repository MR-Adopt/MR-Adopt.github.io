Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it seems that the transformation function is simply copying the value of 'element1' to 'element2'. However, there are a few additional considerations to keep in mind:

1. Null values: If 'element1' is null, 'element2' should also be null.
2. Empty string: If 'element1' is an empty string, 'element2' should also be an empty string.
3. Object reference: If 'element1' is an object reference, 'element2' should be the same object reference.

With these considerations in mind, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class ORSetTest_testCompareDifferentSets {
    public static String inputTransformation_testCompareDifferentSets(String element1)  {
        String element2 = element1;
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function will copy the value of 'element1' to 'element2' while considering the additional conditions mentioned above.
