The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. `jw` is an instance of `JsonWriter` that is used to write the resulting JSON.
2. `lts` is an array of `LocalTime` objects that need to be serialized.
3. `manifest` is a `Class` object representing the type of the deserialized object.
4. `body` is a byte array containing the serialized JSON.
5. `size` is the size of the serialized JSON.

Based on this relationship, the transformation function can be generated as follows:

```java
public class DateTest_localTimeBoundary {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_localTimeBoundary(JsonWriter jw, LocalTime[] lts) {
        Class<LocalTime[]> manifest = LocalTime[].class;
        byte[] body = jw.toByteArray();
        int size = body.length;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(manifest, body, size);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

The transformation function takes `jw` and `lts` as input and transforms them into `manifest`, `body`, and `size`. The `manifest` is set to `LocalTime[].class`, the `body` is obtained by calling `jw.toByteArray()`, and the `size` is calculated as the length of the `body` array. The transformed inputs are then returned as a list.
