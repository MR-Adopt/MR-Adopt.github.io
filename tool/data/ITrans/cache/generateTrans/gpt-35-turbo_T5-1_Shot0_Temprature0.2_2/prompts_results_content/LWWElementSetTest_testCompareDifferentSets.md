Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce that the transformation function should create a new `Element` object with the same `key` as the source input `element1`, but with a different `value`.

The transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class LWWElementSetTest_testCompareDifferentSets {
    public static Element inputTransformation_testCompareDifferentSets(Element element1)  {
        Element element2 = new Element(element1.key, 2, element1.bias);
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new `Element` object with the same `key` as `element1`, but with a `value` of 2. This transformation ensures that the follow-up input `element2` has a different value than the source input `element1`.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the desired transformation is to change the `value` of the `Element` object while keeping the `key` the same.
