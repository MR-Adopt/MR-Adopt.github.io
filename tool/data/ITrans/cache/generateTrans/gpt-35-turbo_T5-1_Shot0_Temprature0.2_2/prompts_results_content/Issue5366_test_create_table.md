Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation function is replacing certain characters and removing unnecessary spaces in the SQL string. The following transformations can be deduced:

1. Replace occurrences of " ( " with "(".
2. Replace occurrences of "( " with "(".
3. Replace occurrences of " )" with ")".
4. Replace occurrences of "\t" with " ".
5. Replace occurrences of "\n" with " ".
6. Replace occurrences of "\'" with "\"".
7. Replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space.
8. Replace occurrences of ", " with ",".
9. Replace occurrences of " ," with ",".

Based on these observations, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class Issue5366_test_create_table {
    public static String inputTransformation_test_create_table(String sql)  {
        sql = sql.replace(" ( ", "(")
                .replace("( ", "(")
                .replace(" )", ")")
                .replace("\t", " ")
                .replace("\n", " ")
                .replace("\'", "\"")
                .replaceAll("\\s+", " ")
                .replace(", ", ",")
                .replace(" ,", ",");
        return sql;
    }
}
```

This transformation function should be able to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided test case and other input pairs.
