Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce that the transformation from the 'SOURCE INPUT' to the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is performed by encoding the 'SOURCE INPUT' using the Base64 encoding algorithm.

To generate the transformation function, we can create a method called `inputTransformation_testCustomBase64` that takes a byte array as input and returns the corresponding Base64 encoded string. Here's the updated code skeleton:

```java
public class Base64Test_testCustomBase64 {
    public static String inputTransformation_testCustomBase64(byte[] testDataBytes)  {
        return Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
    }
}
```

The `Base64.encode` method is the same as the `encode` method in the 'METHOD UNDER TEST' section. It takes a byte array as input and returns the Base64 encoded string.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'SOURCE INPUT' is a byte array and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a Base64 encoded string.
