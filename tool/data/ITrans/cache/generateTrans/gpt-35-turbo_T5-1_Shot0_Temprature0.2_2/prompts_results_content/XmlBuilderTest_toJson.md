Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `XmlBuilder.parse` method is used to parse an XML string and create an `XmlBuilder` object. The `XmlBuilder` object is then used to convert the XML data to JSON format using the `toJson` method.

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` (XML string) into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` (XmlBuilder object), we can create a function `inputTransformation_toJson` that performs the following steps:

1. Parse the XML string using the `XmlBuilder.parse` method to create an `XmlBuilder` object.
2. Return the created `XmlBuilder` object.

Here is the updated code skeleton for the `inputTransformation_toJson` function:

```java
public class XmlBuilderTest_toJson {
    public static XmlBuilder inputTransformation_toJson(String XML) {
        XmlBuilder xmlBuilder = XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
        return xmlBuilder;
    }
}
```

The deduced relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` is that the `XmlBuilder.parse` method can be used to convert the XML string into an `XmlBuilder` object.
