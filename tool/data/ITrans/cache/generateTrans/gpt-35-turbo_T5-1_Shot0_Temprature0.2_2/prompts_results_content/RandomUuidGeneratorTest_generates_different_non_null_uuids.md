The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a new instance of the same class as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

To create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply instantiate a new object of the same class as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class RandomUuidGeneratorTest_generates_different_non_null_uuids {
    public static UuidGenerator inputTransformation_generates_different_non_null_uuids(UuidGenerator generator)  {
        UuidGenerator generator2 = new RandomUuidGenerator();
        return generator2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' needs to be a new instance of the same class as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
