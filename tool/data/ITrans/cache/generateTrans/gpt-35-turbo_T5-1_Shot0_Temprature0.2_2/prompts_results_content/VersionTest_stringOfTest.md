Based on the provided test case, we can deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`v`) and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`version1`) as follows:

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' (`v`) is a string representation of a version number.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`version1`) is the `Version` object created from the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`v`) using the `valueOf` method.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`v`) into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`version1`), we can simply call the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class with the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the argument.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class VersionTest_stringOfTest {
    public static Version inputTransformation_stringOfTest(String version)  {
        Version version1 = Version.valueOf(version);
        return version1;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to transform any input string representing a version number into a `Version` object, similar to the provided test case.
