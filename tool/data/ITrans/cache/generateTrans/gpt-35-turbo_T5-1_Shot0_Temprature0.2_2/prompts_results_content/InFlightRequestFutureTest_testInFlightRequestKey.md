Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'group' attribute of the 'InFlightRequestKey' object remains the same in both the source and follow-up inputs.
2. The 'int' attributes 'attr1' and 'attr2' of the 'InFlightRequestKey' object are incremented by 1 in the follow-up input compared to the source input.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class InFlightRequestFutureTest_testInFlightRequestKey {
    public static InFlightRequestKey inputTransformation_testInFlightRequestKey(InFlightRequestKey requestKey1)  {
        InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey(requestKey1.getGroup(), requestKey1.getAttr1() + 1, requestKey1.getAttr2() + 1);
        return requestKey2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' (requestKey1) as a parameter and creates a new 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (requestKey2) by incrementing the 'attr1' and 'attr2' attributes by 1. The 'group' attribute remains the same as the source input.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'group' attribute remains the same and the 'attr1' and 'attr2' attributes need to be incremented by 1.
