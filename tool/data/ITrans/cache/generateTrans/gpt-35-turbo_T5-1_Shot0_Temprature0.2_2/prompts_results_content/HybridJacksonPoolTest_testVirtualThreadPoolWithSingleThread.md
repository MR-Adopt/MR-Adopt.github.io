The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that both 'virtualPool' and 'virtualPool2' are instances of the class 'HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool' with the same constructor argument.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create a function that takes a 'HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool' object as input and returns a new instance of the same class with the same constructor argument.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class HybridJacksonPoolTest_testVirtualThreadPoolWithSingleThread {
    public static HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool inputTransformation_testVirtualThreadPoolWithSingleThread(HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool)  {
        HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(virtualPool.getCapacity());
        return virtualPool2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of 'HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool' called 'virtualPool2' with the same capacity as the 'virtualPool' object passed as input.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they are instances of 'HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool' with the same constructor argument.
