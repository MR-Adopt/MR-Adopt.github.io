Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and follow-up input:

1. The year of the follow-up input (`year3`) is always the same as the year of the source input (`year1`).
2. The half of the follow-up input (`half3`) is always the same as the half of the source input (`half1`).

To transform the source input into the follow-up input, we can simply copy the values of `year1` and `half1` to `year3` and `half3`, respectively.

Here's the updated transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_withHalf_int {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_withHalf_int(int year1, int half1, int half2)  {
        int year3 = year1;
        int half3 = half1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the follow-up input for the provided test case as well as for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
