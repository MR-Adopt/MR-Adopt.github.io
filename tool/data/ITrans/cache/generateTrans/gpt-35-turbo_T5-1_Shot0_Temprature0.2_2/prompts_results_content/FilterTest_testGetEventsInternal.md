Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation function should create a new instance of the `Filter` class and add the same events as the source input to the follow-up input.

The transformation function can be generated as follows:

```java
public class FilterTest_testGetEventsInternal {
    public static Filter inputTransformation_testGetEventsInternal(Filter filter) {
        Filter filter2 = new Filter();
        for (Filter.FilterEvent event : filter.getEventsInternal()) {
            filter2.add(event);
        }
        return filter2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of `Filter` called `filter2` and iterates over the events in the `filter` object. It adds each event to the `filter2` object using the `add` method. Finally, it returns the `filter2` object as the follow-up input.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics. It ensures that the follow-up input is a new instance of `Filter` with the same events as the source input.
