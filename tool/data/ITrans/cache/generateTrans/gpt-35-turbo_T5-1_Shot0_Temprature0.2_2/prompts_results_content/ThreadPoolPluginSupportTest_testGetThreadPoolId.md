Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` (`support`) is created using the `SOURCE INPUT` (`executor`) in the following way:

1. The `getThreadPoolId()` method is called on the `executor` object to obtain the thread-pool id.
2. The obtained thread-pool id is then passed as an argument to the constructor of the `TestSupport` class, along with the `executor` and `manager` objects.

Therefore, the transformation function can be created as follows:

```java
public class ThreadPoolPluginSupportTest_testGetThreadPoolId {
    public static ThreadPoolPluginSupport inputTransformation_testGetThreadPoolId(ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor)  {
        String threadPoolId = executor.getThreadPoolId();
        ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(threadPoolId, executor, manager);
        return support;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object as input and returns a `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object. It first retrieves the thread-pool id from the `executor` object using the `getThreadPoolId()` method. Then, it creates a new `TestSupport` object using the retrieved thread-pool id, the `executor` object, and the `manager` object.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they involve an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object as the `SOURCE INPUT` and a `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object as the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`.
