Based on the given test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the relationship between 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case as follows:

- The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a version string in the format "x.y" where x and y are integers representing the major and minor version numbers respectively.
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a version string in the same format as the 'SOURCE INPUT', but with a higher minor version number.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we need to increment the minor version number by 1 while keeping the major version number the same.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case and other input pairs:

```java
public class VersionTest_isLowerThanTest {
    public static String inputTransformation_isLowerThanTest(String version)  {
        String[] parts = version.split("\\.");
        int major = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int minor = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
        minor++; // Increment the minor version number by 1
        return major + "." + minor;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the given test case and other input pairs.
