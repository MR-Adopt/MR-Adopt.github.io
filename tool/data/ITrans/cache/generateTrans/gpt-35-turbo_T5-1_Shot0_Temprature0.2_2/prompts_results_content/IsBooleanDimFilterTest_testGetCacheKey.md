Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation from the source input `f3` to the follow-up input `f4` is simply creating a new instance of the `EqualityFilter` class with the same field, column type, value, and null handling.

Therefore, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class IsBooleanDimFilterTest_testGetCacheKey {
    public static EqualityFilter inputTransformation_testGetCacheKey(EqualityFilter f3)  {
        EqualityFilter f4 = new EqualityFilter(f3.getField(), f3.getColumnType(), f3.getValue(), f3.getNullHandling());
        return f4;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they follow the same pattern of creating a new instance of the `EqualityFilter` class with the same field, column type, value, and null handling.
