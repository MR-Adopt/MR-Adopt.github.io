Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

- The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a version string in the format "X.Y" where X and Y are integers representing the major and minor version numbers respectively.
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a version string in the same format "X.Y" but with a different major or minor version number.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can modify the major or minor version number of the 'SOURCE INPUT' while keeping the other version number the same.

Here is the transformation function for the given test case and other input pairs:

```java
public class VersionTest_isEqualTest {
    public static String inputTransformation_isEqualTest(String version)  {
        String[] vs = version.split("\\.");
        int major = Integer.parseInt(vs[0]);
        int minor = Integer.parseInt(vs[1]);
        
        // Increment the major version number by 1
        major++;
        
        // Construct the transformed version string
        String transformedVersion = major + "." + minor;
        
        return transformedVersion;
    }
}
```

This transformation function increments the major version number of the 'SOURCE INPUT' by 1 and keeps the minor version number the same to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics by calling the `inputTransformation_isEqualTest` function with the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the argument to get the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
