The given program under test is a Base64-Double-UrlEncode-Safe encoding and decoding utility. The encode method takes a string as input and encodes it using Base64 encoding, and then performs a double URL encoding. The decode method reverses the process by first performing a double URL decoding and then decoding the Base64 encoded string.

Based on the provided test case, we can deduce that the relationship between the SOURCE INPUT (input) and the FOLLOW UP INPUT (encoded2) is as follows:
1. The input string is encoded using the encode method.
2. The resulting encoded string is assigned to the encoded2 variable.

To create the transformation function, we need to reverse the process and decode the encoded2 string to obtain the original input string. The transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafeTest_testEncodeAndDecode {
    public static String inputTransformation_testEncodeAndDecode(String input) throws java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException  {
        String encoded2 = Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe.encode(input);
        return encoded2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the input string as a parameter, encodes it using the encode method, and returns the resulting encoded string.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the corresponding encoded strings.
