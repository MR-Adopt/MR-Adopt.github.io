The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a List of Strings, where each String represents an ID.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a JSON string representation of the 'SOURCE INPUT' List.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class ListTest1_test1 {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test1(List<String> v01) {
        String str2 = JSON.toJSONString(v01);
        java.lang.reflect.Type listType = new TypeReference<List<String>>() {}.getType();
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(str2, listType);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a List of Strings as the 'SOURCE INPUT' and returns a List of Objects as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. The function uses the `JSON.toJSONString()` method from the provided 'METHOD UNDER TEST' to convert the 'SOURCE INPUT' into a JSON string representation. It also uses the `TypeReference` class to capture the generic type information of the List. The transformed inputs are then returned as a List containing the JSON string and the listType.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics by passing the appropriate List of Strings as the 'SOURCE INPUT' to the function.
