Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'tier' and 'tier2' values remain the same in both the source and follow-up inputs.
2. The 'historicals' and 'historicals2' lists have the same elements in the same order.
3. The 'maxSegmentsToMoveInTier' value remains the same in both the source and follow-up inputs.

Based on this relationship, we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest_testHalfSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenFullSkew {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testHalfSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenFullSkew(String tier, List<ServerHolder> historicals)  {
        String tier2 = tier;
        List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = historicals;
        int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(tier2, historicals2, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'tier' and 'historicals' from the source input and assigns them to the corresponding variables in the follow-up input. The 'maxSegmentsToMoveInTier' value is set to the maximum possible value. The transformed inputs are returned as a list.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as the relationship between the source and follow-up inputs remains the same.
