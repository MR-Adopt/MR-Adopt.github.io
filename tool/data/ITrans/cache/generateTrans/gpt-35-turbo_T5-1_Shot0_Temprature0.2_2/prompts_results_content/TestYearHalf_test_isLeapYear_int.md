Based on the provided test case, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input (`year`, `half`) and the follow-up input (`test2`):

1. The `year` value in the source input is used to create the `YearHalf` object `test` using the `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method.
2. The `year` value in the follow-up input is used to create the `YearHalf` object `test2` using the `YearHalf.of(year2, halfValue)` method.
3. The `half` value in the source input is used as is in the `YearHalf.of(year, half)` method.
4. The `halfValue` value in the follow-up input is a fixed value of `1`.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_isLeapYear_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_isLeapYear_int(int year, Half half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, 1);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the `year` and `half` values as input and creates a new `YearHalf` object `test2` using the `YearHalf.of(year, 1)` method. The `1` value for `halfValue` is fixed based on the deduced relationship.
