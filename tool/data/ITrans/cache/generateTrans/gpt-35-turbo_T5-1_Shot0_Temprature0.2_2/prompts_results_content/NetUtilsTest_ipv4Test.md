The given program under test consists of two methods: `ipv4ToLong` and `longToIpv4`. The `ipv4ToLong` method takes a string representation of an IPv4 address and converts it into a long value. The `longToIpv4` method takes a long value and converts it back into a string representation of an IPv4 address.

From the given test case, we can deduce that the relationship between the source input `ipStr1` and the follow-up input `ipLong2` is that `ipLong2` is the long representation of `ipStr1`.

To create the transformation function, we need to convert the source input `ipStr1` into the follow-up input `ipLong2`. We can achieve this by calling the `ipv4ToLong` method with `ipStr1` as the argument.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class NetUtilsTest_ipv4Test {
    public static long inputTransformation_ipv4Test(String ipStr1)  {
        long ipLong2 = NetUtils.ipv4ToLong(ipStr1);
        return ipLong2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the follow-up input for the given test case and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
