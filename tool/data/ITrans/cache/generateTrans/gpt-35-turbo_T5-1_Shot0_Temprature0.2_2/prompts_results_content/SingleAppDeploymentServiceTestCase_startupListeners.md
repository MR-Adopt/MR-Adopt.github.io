The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT'. 

To create a transformation function that converts the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can simply return the 'SOURCE INPUT' itself.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class SingleAppDeploymentServiceTestCase_startupListeners {
    public static StartupListener inputTransformation_startupListeners(StartupListener startUpListener1)  {
        StartupListener startUpListener2 = startUpListener1;
        return startUpListener2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided 'SOURCE INPUT' as well as for other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
