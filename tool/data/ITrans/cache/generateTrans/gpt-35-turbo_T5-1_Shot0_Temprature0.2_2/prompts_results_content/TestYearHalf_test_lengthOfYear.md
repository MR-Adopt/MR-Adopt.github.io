The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. The 'year' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT' is used to create an instance of 'YearHalf' called 'test'.
2. The 'year' value in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is used to create another instance of 'YearHalf' called 'test2'.
3. The 'half' value in both the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same.

Based on this relationship, we can create a transformation function that takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns an instance of 'YearHalf' with the same 'half' value but a different 'year' value.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_lengthOfYear {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_lengthOfYear(int year, Half half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half);
        return test2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the given 'SOURCE INPUT' as well as for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
