The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:
- The 'mockEvent' in the 'SOURCE INPUT' is added to the 'filter' using the `add` method.
- The 'mockEvent2' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is added to the 'filter2' using the `add` method.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we need to create a function that takes 'mockEvent' and 'filter' as input and returns 'mockEvent2' and 'filter2' as output.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class FilterTest_testGetNewEvents {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testGetNewEvents(Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent, Filter filter) {
        Filter filter2 = new Filter();
        filter2.add(mockEvent);
        Filter.FilterEvent mockEvent2 = new FilterEventMock();
        filter2.add(mockEvent2);
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(mockEvent2, filter2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of 'Filter' called 'filter2' and adds 'mockEvent' to it using the `add` method. Then, it creates a new instance of 'FilterEventMock' called 'mockEvent2' and adds it to 'filter2' using the `add` method as well. Finally, it returns a list containing 'mockEvent2' and 'filter2' as the transformed inputs.

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
