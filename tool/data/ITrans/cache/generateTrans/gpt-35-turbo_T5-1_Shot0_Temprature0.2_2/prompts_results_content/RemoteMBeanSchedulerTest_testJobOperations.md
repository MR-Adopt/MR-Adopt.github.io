Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' is an instance of the class `JobDetail` created using the `newJob` method with a specific job key and other optional parameters.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is an instance of the class `JobKey` created using the same job key as the 'SOURCE INPUT' and the constant value `GROUP_KEY`.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we need to extract the job key from the 'SOURCE INPUT' and create a new instance of `JobKey` using the extracted job key and the constant value `GROUP_KEY`.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class RemoteMBeanSchedulerTest_testJobOperations {
    public static JobKey inputTransformation_testJobOperations(JobDetail job2Detail) {
        String jobName = job2Detail.getKey().getName();
        JobKey job22 = new JobKey(jobName, GROUP_KEY);
        return job22;
    }
}
```

This transformation function extracts the job name from the 'SOURCE INPUT' using the `getKey().getName()` method and creates a new instance of `JobKey` using the extracted job name and the constant value `GROUP_KEY`.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
