Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The follow-up input `year3` is always equal to `year2`.
2. The follow-up input `half3` is always equal to `half1`.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_with_TemporalAdjuster_Year {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_with_TemporalAdjuster_Year(int year1, int half1, int year2)  {
        int year3 = year2;
        int half3 = half1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the source input `year1`, `half1`, and `year2` as parameters and returns a list containing the transformed follow-up input `year3` and `half3`. The transformation function applies the deduced relationship to generate the follow-up input values.
