The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

- The 'generatorA' and 'generatorB' objects are instances of the 'SubRuleContext.Generator' class.
- The 'NAME' and 'NAME2' variables are strings.

Based on this relationship, we can create a transformation function that takes the 'generatorA' and 'NAME' as input and generates the 'generatorB' and 'NAME2' as output. The transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class SubRuleContextTest_testEquals {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testEquals(SubRuleContext.Generator generatorA, String NAME) {
        SubRuleContext.Generator generatorB = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
        String NAME2 = new String(NAME);
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(generatorB, NAME2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of 'SubRuleContext.Generator' called 'generatorB' and assigns it to the 'generatorB' variable. It also creates a new string called 'NAME2' and assigns it the value of 'NAME'. The transformed inputs are then returned as a list.

This transformation function can be applied to the provided input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
