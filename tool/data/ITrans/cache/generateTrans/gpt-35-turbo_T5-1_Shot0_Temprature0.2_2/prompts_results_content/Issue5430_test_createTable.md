To deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case, we can observe that the 'normalizeSql' method replaces certain characters and patterns in the input 'sql' string. The replacements include removing spaces around parentheses, replacing tabs and newlines with spaces, replacing single quotes with double quotes, and removing consecutive spaces.

Based on this observation, we can create a transformation function that performs the same replacements on the 'SOURCE INPUT' to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Here is the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class Issue5430_test_createTable {
    public static String inputTransformation_test_createTable(String sql)  {
        sql = sql.replace(" ( ", "(")
                .replace("( ", "(")
                .replace(" )", ")")
                .replace("\t", " ")
                .replace("\n", " ")
                .replace("\'", "\"")
                .replaceAll("\\s+", " ");
        return sql;
    }
}
```

This transformation function replaces " ( " with "(", "( " with "(", " )" with ")", tabs and newlines with spaces, and single quotes with double quotes. It also removes consecutive spaces by using the regular expression "\\s+".

The transformation function can be applied to the provided 'OTHER INPUT PAIRS' and potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
