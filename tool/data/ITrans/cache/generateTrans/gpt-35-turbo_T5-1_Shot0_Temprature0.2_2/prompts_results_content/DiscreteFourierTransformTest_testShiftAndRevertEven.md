Based on the provided test case and the program under test, it can be observed that the `shift` method takes a matrix as input and rearranges its elements to shift the first and second halves of the rows and columns. The rearrangement puts the zero-frequency term in the middle and the conjugate pairs at equal distances from the center.

To deduce the relationship between the source input (`original`) and the follow-up input (`shifted2`), we can analyze the code in the test case. The follow-up input (`shifted2`) is obtained by applying the `shift` method to the source input (`original`).

Therefore, the relationship between the source input and the follow-up input can be defined as follows:
- The follow-up input (`shifted2`) is obtained by calling the `shift` method with the source input (`original`) as the argument.

Based on this relationship, we can generate the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class DiscreteFourierTransformTest_testShiftAndRevertEven {
    public static MatrixStore<Double> inputTransformation_testShiftAndRevertEven(Primitive64Store original) {
        MatrixStore<Double> shifted2 = DiscreteFourierTransform.shift(original);
        return shifted2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the source input (`original`) as a parameter and returns the follow-up input (`shifted2`) by calling the `shift` method with the source input as the argument.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics by passing the respective source inputs to the function and obtaining the corresponding follow-up inputs.
