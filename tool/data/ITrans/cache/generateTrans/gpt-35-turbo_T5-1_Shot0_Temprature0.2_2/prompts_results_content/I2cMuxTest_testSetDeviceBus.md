Based on the provided information, the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' can be deduced as follows:

- The 'SOURCE INPUT' consists of an instance of the `I2cMux` class named `i2cMux` and a string variable named `deviceBus`.
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' consists of an instance of the `I2cMux` class named `i2cMux2`.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create a function named `inputTransformation_testSetDeviceBus` as follows:

```java
public class I2cMuxTest_testSetDeviceBus {
    public static I2cMux inputTransformation_testSetDeviceBus(I2cMux i2cMux, String deviceBus) {
        I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
        return i2cMux2;
    }
}
```

This function creates a new instance of the `I2cMux` class named `i2cMux2` using the `Runtime.start` method. The method takes two arguments: the name of the instance ("i2cMux") and the class name ("I2cMux"). This ensures that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is created in the same way as in the test case.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided input pairs as well as for other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
