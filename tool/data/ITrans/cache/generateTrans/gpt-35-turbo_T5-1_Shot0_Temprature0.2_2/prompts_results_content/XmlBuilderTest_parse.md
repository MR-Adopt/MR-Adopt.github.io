Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `parse` method takes an XML string as input and returns an `XmlBuilder` object. The `asString` method of the `XmlBuilder` class converts the data stored in the `XmlBuilder` object back to an XML string.

From the test case, we can deduce that the transformation function should take an XML string as input and return an `XmlBuilder` object.

To generate the transformation function, we can simply call the `parse` method of the `XmlBuilder` class with the XML string as the argument.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class XmlBuilderTest_parse {
    public static XmlBuilder inputTransformation_parse(String XML)  {
        return XmlBuilder.parse(XML);
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to transform the `SOURCE INPUT` (XML string) into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` (XmlBuilder object) for the provided test case. It should also be applicable to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
