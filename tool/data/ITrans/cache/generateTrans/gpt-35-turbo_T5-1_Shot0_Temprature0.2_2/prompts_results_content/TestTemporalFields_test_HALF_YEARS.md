Based on the provided test case, it seems that the transformation function is adding the `amount` to the `quarter1` and assigning the result to `quarter2`. The `year2` remains the same as `year1`.

Here is the completed transformation function:

```java
public class TestTemporalFields_test_HALF_YEARS {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_HALF_YEARS(int year1, int quarter1) {
        int year2 = year1;
        int quarter2 = quarter1 + 1;
        int amount = 1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year2, quarter2, amount);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function assumes that the `quarter1` value is between 1 and 4 (inclusive). It increments the `quarter1` value by 1 to get the `quarter2` value. The `year2` value remains the same as `year1`, and `amount` is set to 1.

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
