The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'pluginId' is derived from the 'plugin' object. 

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' (plugin) into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (pluginId), we can use the 'getName()' method of the 'plugin' object.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class ThreadPoolPluginSupportTest_testGetPlugin {
    public static String inputTransformation_testGetPlugin(ThreadPoolPlugin plugin)  {
        String pluginId = plugin.getName();
        return pluginId;
    }
}
```

This transformation function extracts the name of the 'plugin' object using the 'getName()' method and assigns it to the 'pluginId' variable. The 'pluginId' is then returned as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
