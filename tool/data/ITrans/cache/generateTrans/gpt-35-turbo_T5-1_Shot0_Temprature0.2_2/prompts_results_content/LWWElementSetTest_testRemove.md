Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it seems that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`element2`) is identical to the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`element`) in terms of the key, value, and bias. However, the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a separate instance of the `Element` class.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create a new instance of the `Element` class using the same key, value, and bias as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

Here is the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class LWWElementSetTest_testRemove {
    public static Element inputTransformation_testRemove(Element element) {
        Element element2 = new Element(element.key, element.value, element.bias);
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new `Element` object (`element2`) with the same key, value, and bias as the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`element`), and returns it as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' should have the same key, value, and bias as the 'SOURCE INPUT', but be a separate instance of the `Element` class.
