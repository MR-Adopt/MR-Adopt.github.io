Based on the provided test case, it can be observed that the `generator2` object is created as a new instance of `SubRuleContext.Generator` class. The `generate` method is then called on this new instance with the input `"name"`. 

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`, we can create a function `inputTransformation_testGetters` that takes in the `generator` and `NAME` as parameters. Inside this function, we can create a new instance of `SubRuleContext.Generator` called `generator2` and call the `generate` method on it with the input `"name"`. 

For the `id` parameter, we can assign it the value `-1.7976931348623157E308`, which is the same value as in the test case.

Here's the updated code skeleton for the `inputTransformation_testGetters` function:

```java
public class SubRuleContextTest_testGetters {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testGetters(SubRuleContext.Generator generator, String NAME)  {
        SubRuleContext.Generator generator2 = new SubRuleContext.Generator();
        generator2.generate("name");
        Double id = -1.7976931348623157E308;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(generator2, id);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the `FOLLOW UP INPUT` for the provided test case, as well as for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
