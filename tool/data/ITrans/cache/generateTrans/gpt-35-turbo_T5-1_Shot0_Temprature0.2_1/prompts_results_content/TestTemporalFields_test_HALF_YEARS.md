Based on the provided test case, it seems that the intention is to add a certain amount of quarters to a given `YearQuarter` object. The `addTo` method is expected to return a new `YearQuarter` object with the added quarters.

To deduce the relationship between the source input and the follow-up input, we can observe the following:

1. The `year1` and `quarter1` values are used to create the initial `YearQuarter` object using the `of` method.
2. The `year2` and `quarter2` values are used to create another `YearQuarter` object using the `of` method.
3. The `amount` value is used as the number of quarters to add to the second `YearQuarter` object using the `addTo` method.
4. The expected result is the first `YearQuarter` object.

Based on this analysis, we can deduce that the relationship between the source input and the follow-up input is as follows:

- The `year2` and `quarter2` values are the same as the `year1` and `quarter1` values.
- The `amount` value is the number of quarters to add to the `quarter2` value.

Therefore, the transformation function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class TestTemporalFields_test_HALF_YEARS {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_HALF_YEARS(int year1, int quarter1)  {
        int year2 = year1;
        int quarter2 = quarter1;
        int amount = 1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year2, quarter2, amount);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
