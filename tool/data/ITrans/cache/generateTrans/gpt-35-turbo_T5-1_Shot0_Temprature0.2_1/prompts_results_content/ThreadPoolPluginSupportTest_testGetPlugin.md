The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'pluginId' is derived from the 'plugin' object. 

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' (plugin) into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (pluginId), we can use the 'getId()' method of the 'plugin' object to obtain the pluginId.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class ThreadPoolPluginSupportTest_testGetPlugin {
    public static String inputTransformation_testGetPlugin(ThreadPoolPlugin plugin)  {
        String pluginId = plugin.getId();
        return pluginId;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (pluginId) from any 'SOURCE INPUT' (plugin) that has a 'getId()' method.
