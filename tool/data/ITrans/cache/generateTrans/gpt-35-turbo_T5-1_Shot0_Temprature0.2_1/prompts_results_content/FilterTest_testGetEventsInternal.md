Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation from the source input `filter` to the follow-up input `filter2` involves creating a new instance of the `Filter` class and adding the same events as the source input.

To transform the source input `filter` into the follow-up input `filter2`, the following transformation function can be used:

```java
public class FilterTest_testGetEventsInternal {
    public static Filter inputTransformation_testGetEventsInternal(Filter filter)  {
        Filter filter2 = new Filter();
        for (Filter.FilterEvent event : filter.getEventsInternal()) {
            filter2.add(event);
        }
        return filter2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of the `Filter` class, iterates over the events in the source input `filter` using the `getEventsInternal()` method, and adds each event to the follow-up input `filter2` using the `add()` method.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, ensuring that the events from the source input are copied to the follow-up input.
