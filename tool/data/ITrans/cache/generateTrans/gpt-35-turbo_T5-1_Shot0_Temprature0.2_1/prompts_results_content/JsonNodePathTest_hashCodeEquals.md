Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the `hashCode()` method of the `JsonNodePath` class returns the same hash code for two instances that have the same `pathSegment` and `pathSegmentIndex` values.

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`, we need to create a new `JsonNodePath` instance with the same `pathSegment` and `pathSegmentIndex` values as the `SOURCE INPUT`.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class JsonNodePathTest_hashCodeEquals {
    public static JsonNodePath inputTransformation_hashCodeEquals(JsonNodePath a1)  {
        JsonNodePath a2 = new JsonNodePath(a1.getPathType());
        a2.setPathSegment(a1.getPathSegment());
        a2.setPathSegmentIndex(a1.getPathSegmentIndex());
        return a2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new `JsonNodePath` instance `a2` with the same `pathType` as `a1`. It then sets the `pathSegment` and `pathSegmentIndex` values of `a2` to be the same as `a1`. Finally, it returns `a2` as the transformed `FOLLOW UP INPUT`.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as they have the same `pathSegment` and `pathSegmentIndex` values.
