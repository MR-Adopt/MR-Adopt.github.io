Based on the provided information, it seems that the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`ap`) and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`type`) is that the value of `type` is obtained from the `activityType` property of the `ap` object.

To create the transformation function, you can simply access the `activityType` property of the `ap` object and assign it to the `type` variable.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case:

```java
public class ScoringConfigGroupTest_testAddActivityParams {
    public static String inputTransformation_testAddActivityParams(ActivityParams ap)  {
        String type = ap.getActivityType();
        return type;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`type`) from any given 'SOURCE INPUT' (`ap`) where `ap` is an instance of the `ActivityParams` class.
