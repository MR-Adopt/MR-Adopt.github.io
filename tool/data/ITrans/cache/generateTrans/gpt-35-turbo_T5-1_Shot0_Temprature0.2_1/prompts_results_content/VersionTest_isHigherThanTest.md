Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' have the same major version number.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' has a higher minor version number than the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
3. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' has the same major and minor version numbers as the 'SOURCE INPUT', but a higher revision number.
4. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' has the same major, minor, and revision version numbers as the 'SOURCE INPUT', but a higher build number.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' as follows:

```java
public class VersionTest_isHigherThanTest {
    public static String inputTransformation_isHigherThanTest(String version)  {
        String[] vs = version.split("\\.");
        int major = Integer.parseInt(vs[0]);
        int minor = Integer.parseInt(vs[1]);
        int revision = (vs.length > 2 ? Integer.parseInt(vs[2]) : 0);
        int build = (vs.length > 3 ? Integer.parseInt(vs[3]) : 0);
        
        // Increment the minor version number
        minor++;
        
        // Reset the revision and build numbers
        revision = 0;
        build = 0;
        
        // Construct the transformed version string
        String transformedVersion = major + "." + minor + "." + revision + "." + build;
        
        return transformedVersion;
    }
}
```

This transformation function increments the minor version number by 1 and resets the revision and build numbers to 0. It then constructs the transformed version string using the updated numbers.

This transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' remains the same.
