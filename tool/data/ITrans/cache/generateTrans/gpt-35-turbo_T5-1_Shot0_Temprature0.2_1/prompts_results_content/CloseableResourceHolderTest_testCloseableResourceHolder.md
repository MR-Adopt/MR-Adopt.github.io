The method under test, `fromCloseable`, takes a `Closeable` object as input and returns a `ResourceHolder` object. The `ResourceHolder` object is created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` class, which is a subclass of `ResourceHolder` specifically designed for `Closeable` resources.

In the given test case, the `fromCloseable` method is called with the `closeable` object as the input. The returned `ResourceHolder` object is then assigned to the `holder` variable. Additionally, a new `CloseableResourceHolder` object is created using the `closeable` object and assigned to the `holder2` variable. Finally, an assertion is made to ensure that the `get` method of `holder2` returns the same `closeable` object.

From the test case, we can deduce that the transformation function should create a new `ResourceHolder` object using the `CloseableResourceHolder` class and the provided `closeable` object. The transformed input should be the newly created `ResourceHolder` object.

Based on this analysis, we can generate the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class CloseableResourceHolderTest_testCloseableResourceHolder {
    public static ResourceHolder<Closeable> inputTransformation_testCloseableResourceHolder(Closeable closeable)  {
        ResourceHolder<Closeable> holder2 = new CloseableResourceHolder<>(closeable);
        return holder2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a `Closeable` object as input and creates a new `ResourceHolder` object using the `CloseableResourceHolder` class and the provided `closeable` object. The transformed input is the newly created `ResourceHolder` object.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the input is a `Closeable` object and the desired output is a `ResourceHolder` object created using the `CloseableResourceHolder` class.
