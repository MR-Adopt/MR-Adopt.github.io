Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the `encode` method in the `Base64` class is used to encode a byte array into a Base64 encoded string, and the `decode` method is used to decode a Base64 encoded string into a byte array.

The relationship between the `SOURCE INPUT` and `FOLLOW UP INPUT` in the test case is that the `encode` method is used to encode the `testDataBytes` byte array, and the resulting encoded string is assigned to the `input2` variable.

To create a function that transforms the `SOURCE INPUT` into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`, we can reverse the process by using the `decode` method to decode the `input2` string back into a byte array.

Here is the transformation function:

```java
public class Base64Test_testCustomBase64 {
    public static String inputTransformation_testCustomBase64(byte[] testDataBytes) {
        String input2 = Base64.encode(testDataBytes);
        return input2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a byte array `testDataBytes` as input and returns the corresponding Base64 encoded string. It follows the same encoding process as the `encode` method in the `Base64` class.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the input is a valid byte array.
