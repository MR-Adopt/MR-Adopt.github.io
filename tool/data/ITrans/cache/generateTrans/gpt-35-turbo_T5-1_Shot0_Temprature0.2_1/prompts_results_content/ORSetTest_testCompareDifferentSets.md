The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT'. 

Based on this relationship, the transformation function can be created as follows:

```java
public class ORSetTest_testCompareDifferentSets {
    public static String inputTransformation_testCompareDifferentSets(String element1)  {
        String element2 = element1;
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function simply assigns the value of 'element1' to 'element2', resulting in the same value for both variables. This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is expected to be the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
