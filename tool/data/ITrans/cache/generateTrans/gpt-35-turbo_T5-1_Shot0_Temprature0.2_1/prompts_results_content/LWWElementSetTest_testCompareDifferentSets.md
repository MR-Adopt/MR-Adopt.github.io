Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, it seems that the transformation function is simply creating a new `Element` object with a different key but the same bias value as the source input. Therefore, the deduced relationship between the source input `element1` and the follow-up input `element2` is that the key of `element2` is different from the key of `element1`, but the bias value remains the same.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class LWWElementSetTest_testCompareDifferentSets {
    public static Element inputTransformation_testCompareDifferentSets(Element element1)  {
        Element element2 = new Element("key2", element1.bias, element1.timestamp);
        return element2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the key needs to be changed while keeping the bias value the same.
