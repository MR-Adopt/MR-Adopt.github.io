Based on the given test case, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

- The 'year' and 'half' values from the 'SOURCE INPUT' are used to create a new instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.
- The 'year2' and 'halfValue' values from the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' are used to create another instance of the 'YearHalf' class using the 'of' method.
- The 'isLeapYear' method is called on the 'test2' object to determine if the year is a leap year.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_isLeapYear_int {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_isLeapYear_int(int year, Half half)  {
        YearHalf test2 = YearHalf.of(year, half.getValue());
        return test2;
    }
}
```

In the transformation function, we use the 'YearHalf.of' method to create a new instance of 'YearHalf' using the 'year' and 'half' values from the 'SOURCE INPUT'. We pass the 'half.getValue()' as the second argument to the 'of' method to get the corresponding 'halfValue' for the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

This transformation function can be used to generate 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
