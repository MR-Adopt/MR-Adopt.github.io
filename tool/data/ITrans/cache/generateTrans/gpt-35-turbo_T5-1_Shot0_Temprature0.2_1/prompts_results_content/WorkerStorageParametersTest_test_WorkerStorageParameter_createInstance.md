The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. The value of 'l2' is equal to the value of 'l' multiplied by 2.25.
2. The value of 'b' remains the same.

Based on this relationship, we can create a transformation function that takes 'l' as input and returns a list containing the transformed values of 'l2' and 'b'.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class WorkerStorageParametersTest_test_WorkerStorageParameter_createInstance {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_WorkerStorageParameter_createInstance(long l)  {
        long l2 = (long) (l * 2.25);
        boolean b = true;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(l2, b);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
