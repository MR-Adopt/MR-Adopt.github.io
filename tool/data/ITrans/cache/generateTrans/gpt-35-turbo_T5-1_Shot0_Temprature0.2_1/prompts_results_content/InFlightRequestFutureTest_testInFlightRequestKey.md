Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the `hashCode()` method of the `InFlightRequestKey` class returns the same value for two instances if their `group` field values are equal.

To transform the `SOURCE INPUT` into the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`, we need to change the values of the `group` field in the `requestKey1` object to match the `group` field value in the `requestKey2` object.

Here's the transformation function:

```java
public class InFlightRequestFutureTest_testInFlightRequestKey {
    public static InFlightRequestKey inputTransformation_testInFlightRequestKey(InFlightRequestKey requestKey1)  {
        InFlightRequestKey requestKey2 = new InFlightRequestKey(requestKey1.getGroup(), requestKey1.getSomeValue(), requestKey1.getAnotherValue());
        return requestKey2;
    }
}
```

In the transformation function, we create a new `InFlightRequestKey` object `requestKey2` with the same values for the `someValue` and `anotherValue` fields as the `requestKey1` object. The only difference is that we set the `group` field of `requestKey2` to the value of the `group` field in the `requestKey1` object.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the `group` field is the only field that needs to be changed to match the `FOLLOW UP INPUT`.
