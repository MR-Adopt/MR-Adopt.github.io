Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'year' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT' is directly used in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' without any modification.
2. The 'half' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT' is converted to a corresponding string representation in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. The string representation is obtained by appending the letter 'H' followed by the 'half' value to the 'year' value.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_parse_CharSequence {
    public static CharSequence inputTransformation_test_parse_CharSequence(int year, int half)  {
        CharSequence text = year + "-H" + half;
        return text;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns the transformed 'text' value. The 'text' value is obtained by concatenating the 'year' value with the string "-H" and the 'half' value.
