Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'year' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT' is directly used as the year in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' text.
2. The 'half' value in the 'SOURCE INPUT' is used to generate the half-of-year in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' text by appending 'h' followed by the 'half' value.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_parse_CharSequence_caseInsensitive {
    public static CharSequence inputTransformation_test_parse_CharSequence_caseInsensitive(int year, int half)  {
        CharSequence text = year + "-h" + half;
        return text;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and generates the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' text by concatenating the 'year' with "-h" and the 'half' value.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' texts.
