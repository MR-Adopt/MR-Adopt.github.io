Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can observe the following relationship between the source input and the follow-up input:

1. The value of the variable `tier` remains the same in both the source input and the follow-up input.
2. The list of `ServerHolder` objects in the `historicals` variable remains the same in both the source input and the follow-up input.
3. The value of the variable `maxSegmentsToMoveInTier` remains the same in both the source input and the follow-up input.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function that transforms the source input into the follow-up input. Here's the updated code skeleton:

```java
public class SegmentToMoveCalculatorTest_testHalfSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenFullSkew {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testHalfSegmentsArePickedForMoveWhenFullSkew(String tier, List<ServerHolder> historicals)  {
        // TODO: Transform the source input into the follow-up input
        String tier2 = tier;
        List<ServerHolder> historicals2 = historicals;
        int maxSegmentsToMoveInTier = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(tier2, historicals2, maxSegmentsToMoveInTier);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

In this transformation function, we simply assign the values of the source input variables to the corresponding follow-up input variables. This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
