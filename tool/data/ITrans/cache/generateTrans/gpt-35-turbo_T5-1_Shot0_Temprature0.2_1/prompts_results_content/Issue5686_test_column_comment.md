Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation from the source input `sqlStatement` to the follow-up input `sqlStatement2` involves adding comments to the columns in the SQL statement.

To create the transformation function, we can iterate over the columns in the source input `sqlStatement` and add comments to each column in the follow-up input `sqlStatement2`. The comments can be extracted from the source input and appended to the column in the follow-up input.

Here's the transformation function for the given test case and input pairs:

```java
public class Issue5686_test_column_comment {
    public static MySqlInsertStatement inputTransformation_test_column_comment(MySqlInsertStatement sqlStatement) {
        MySqlInsertStatement sqlStatement2 = (MySqlInsertStatement) sqlStatement.clone();
        int ccc = 0;
        for (SQLExpr column : sqlStatement2.getColumns()) {
            column.addAfterComment("-- comment注释" + (ccc++));
        }
        return sqlStatement2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to transform the source input `sqlStatement` into the follow-up input `sqlStatement2` for the given test case. It should also be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the transformation involves adding comments to the columns in the SQL statement.
