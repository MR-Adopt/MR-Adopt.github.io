The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the `setAtomAt` method is called on the `association` object with the `n` atom and the `position` as arguments. This results in the `atoms` array in the `association` object being modified.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we need to create a new `Association` object called `association2` with the modified `atoms` array. The `position2` remains the same as in the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

Here is the generated transformation function:

```java
public class AssociationTest_testGetAtomAt {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_testGetAtomAt(Association association, Atom n, int position)  {
        Association association2 = new Association(association.getAtomAt(position), association.getAtomAt(1));
        int position2 = position;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(association2, position2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
