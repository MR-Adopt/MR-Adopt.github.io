Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

- The major version number remains the same.
- If the minor version number is present in the 'SOURCE INPUT', it is incremented by 1 in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
- If the minor version number is not present in the 'SOURCE INPUT', it is added as '1' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
- If the revision number is present in the 'SOURCE INPUT', it is incremented by 1 in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
- If the revision number is not present in the 'SOURCE INPUT', it is added as '1' in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class VersionTest_isLowerThanTest {
    public static String inputTransformation_isLowerThanTest(String version)  {
        String[] vs = version.split("\\.");
        String major = vs[0];
        String minor = (vs.length > 1 ? vs[1] : null);
        String revision = (vs.length > 2 ? vs[2] : null);
        
        if (minor != null) {
            int minorVersion = Integer.parseInt(minor);
            minor = String.valueOf(minorVersion + 1);
        } else {
            minor = "1";
        }
        
        if (revision != null) {
            int revisionVersion = Integer.parseInt(revision);
            revision = String.valueOf(revisionVersion + 1);
        } else {
            revision = "1";
        }
        
        return major + "." + minor + "." + revision;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a version string as input and splits it into major, minor, and revision components. It then increments the minor and revision components based on the deduced relationship and returns the transformed version string.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
