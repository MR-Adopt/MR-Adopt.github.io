The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:
- The 'SOURCE INPUT' is an instance of the 'I2cMux' class, which is created using the 'Runtime.start' method.
- The 'deviceAddress' is a string representing the address of the 'I2cMux' device.
- The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is another instance of the 'I2cMux' class, which is also created using the 'Runtime.start' method.

Based on this relationship, we can create a transformation function that takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'deviceAddress' as parameters and returns the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. The function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class I2cMuxTest_testSetDeviceAddress {
    public static I2cMux inputTransformation_testSetDeviceAddress(I2cMux i2cMux, String deviceAddress)  {
        I2cMux i2cMux2 = (I2cMux) Runtime.start("i2cMux", "I2cMux");
        return i2cMux2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function creates a new instance of the 'I2cMux' class using the 'Runtime.start' method, which is equivalent to the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'deviceAddress' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' for the provided input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
