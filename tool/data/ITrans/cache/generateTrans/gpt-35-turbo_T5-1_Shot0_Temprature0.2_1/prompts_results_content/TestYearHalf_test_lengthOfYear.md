Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'year' value remains the same in both the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
2. The 'half' value is changed to 1 in the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_lengthOfYear {
    public static YearHalf inputTransformation_test_lengthOfYear(int year, Half half)  {
        return YearHalf.of(year, 1);
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'year' and 'half' values as input and returns a new instance of 'YearHalf' with the same 'year' value and 'half' value set to 1.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the 'year' value remains the same and the 'half' value is changed to 1.
