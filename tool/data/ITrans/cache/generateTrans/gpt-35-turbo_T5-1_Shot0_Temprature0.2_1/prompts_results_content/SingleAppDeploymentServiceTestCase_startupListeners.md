The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the given test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT'. 

To create the transformation function, we can simply return the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Here is the generated transformation function:

```java
public class SingleAppDeploymentServiceTestCase_startupListeners {
    public static StartupListener inputTransformation_startupListeners(StartupListener startUpListener1)  {
        StartupListener startUpListener2 = startUpListener1;
        return startUpListener2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is expected to be the same as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
