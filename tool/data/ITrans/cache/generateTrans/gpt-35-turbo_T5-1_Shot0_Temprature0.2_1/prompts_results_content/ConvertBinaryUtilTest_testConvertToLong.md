Based on the provided code and test case, we can deduce that the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is as follows:

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a string that needs to be converted to a byte array.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is the byte array representation of the 'SOURCE INPUT'.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create a function named `inputTransformation_testConvertToLong` that takes a string as input and converts it into a byte array. The function can be implemented as follows:

```java
public class ConvertBinaryUtilTest_testConvertToLong {
    public static byte[] inputTransformation_testConvertToLong(String randomString)  {
        byte[] randomStringBytes = randomString.getBytes();
        return randomStringBytes;
    }
}
```

This transformation function converts the input string into a byte array using the `getBytes()` method of the `String` class.

The deduced relation and generated transformation function should be applicable to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as the transformation function uses a general method to convert a string to a byte array.
