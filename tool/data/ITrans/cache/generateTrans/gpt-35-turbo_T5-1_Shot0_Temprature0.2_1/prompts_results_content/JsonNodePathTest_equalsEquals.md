Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the transformation function simply returns the value of the source input. In other words, the follow-up input is the same as the source input.

Here is the updated transformation function:

```java
public class JsonNodePathTest_equalsEquals {
    public static String inputTransformation_equalsEquals(String token1)  {
        String token2 = token1;
        return token2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as the relationship between the source input and the follow-up input remains the same.
