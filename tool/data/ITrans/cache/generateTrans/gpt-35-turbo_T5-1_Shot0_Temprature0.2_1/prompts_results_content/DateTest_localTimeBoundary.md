The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. `jw` is an instance of `JsonWriter` used for serializing JSON.
2. `lts` is an array of `LocalTime` objects.
3. `manifest` is the type of the deserialized object, which is `LocalTime[]`.
4. `body` is the serialized JSON byte array.
5. `size` is the size of the serialized JSON byte array.

Based on this relationship, we can create a function `inputTransformation_localTimeBoundary` that transforms the 'SOURCE INPUT' into 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' as follows:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class DateTest_localTimeBoundary {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_localTimeBoundary(JsonWriter jw, LocalTime[] lts) {
        Class<LocalTime[]> manifest = LocalTime[].class;
        byte[] body = jw.toByteArray();
        int size = body.length;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(manifest, body, size);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

The `inputTransformation_localTimeBoundary` function takes `jw` and `lts` as input and transforms them into `manifest`, `body`, and `size`. It returns a list containing the transformed inputs.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
