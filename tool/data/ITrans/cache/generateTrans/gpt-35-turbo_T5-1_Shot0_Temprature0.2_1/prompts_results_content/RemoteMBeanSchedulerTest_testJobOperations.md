Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be deduced that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`job22`) is created by extracting the name and group from the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`job2Detail`) and constructing a new `JobKey` object using those extracted values.

Therefore, the transformation function can be created as follows:

```java
public class RemoteMBeanSchedulerTest_testJobOperations {
    public static JobKey inputTransformation_testJobOperations(JobDetail job2Detail)  {
        String name = job2Detail.getKey().getName();
        String group = job2Detail.getKey().getGroup();
        JobKey job22 = new JobKey(name, group);
        return job22;
    }
}
```

This transformation function extracts the name and group from the `JobDetail` object and uses them to construct a new `JobKey` object, which is then returned as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. This function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
