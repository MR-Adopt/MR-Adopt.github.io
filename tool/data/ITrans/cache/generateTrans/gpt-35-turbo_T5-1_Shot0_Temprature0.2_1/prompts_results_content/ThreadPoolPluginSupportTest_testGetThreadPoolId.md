The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`executor`) and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`support`) in the test case is that the `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object (`support`) is created using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` value.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create a function `inputTransformation_testGetThreadPoolId` that takes an `ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor` object as input and returns a `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object. The function will create a new `ThreadPoolPluginSupport` object using the `executor.getThreadPoolId()` value.

Here's the generated transformation function:

```java
public class ThreadPoolPluginSupportTest_testGetThreadPoolId {
    public static ThreadPoolPluginSupport inputTransformation_testGetThreadPoolId(ExtensibleThreadPoolExecutor executor)  {
        ThreadPoolPluginSupport support = new TestSupport(executor.getThreadPoolId(), executor, manager);
        return support;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to generate the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`support`) for the given 'SOURCE INPUT' (`executor`) in the test case. It can also be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
