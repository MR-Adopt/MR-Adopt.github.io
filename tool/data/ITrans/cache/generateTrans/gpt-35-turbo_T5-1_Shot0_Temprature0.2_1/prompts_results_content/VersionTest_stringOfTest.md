The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that both 'v' and 'version1' are string representations of the same Version object.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can directly call the `valueOf` method of the `Version` class with the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the input parameter.

Here is the generated transformation function:

```java
public class VersionTest_stringOfTest {
    public static Version inputTransformation_stringOfTest(String version)  {
        Version version1 = Version.valueOf(version);
        return version1;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be used to transform additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
