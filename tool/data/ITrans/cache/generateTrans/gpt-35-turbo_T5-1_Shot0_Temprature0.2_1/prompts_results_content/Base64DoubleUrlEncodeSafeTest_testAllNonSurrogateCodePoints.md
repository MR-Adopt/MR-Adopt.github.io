Based on the provided test case and other input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT':

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' is a string that is encoded using the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe.encode()` method to obtain the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

To transform the 'SOURCE INPUT' into the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT', we can create the following transformation function:

```java
public class Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafeTest_testAllNonSurrogateCodePoints {
    public static String inputTransformation_testAllNonSurrogateCodePoints(String input) {
        String encoded2 = Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe.encode(input);
        return encoded2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' as a parameter and uses the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe.encode()` method to encode the input and obtain the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is then returned as the result of the transformation function.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as long as the 'SOURCE INPUT' is a string that needs to be encoded using the `Base64DoubleUrlEncodeSafe.encode()` method to obtain the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
