The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is obtained by calling the `TypeLiteral.listOf()` method with the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the argument.

To create the transformation function, we can define a method `inputTransformation_normalize()` that takes a `Class` object as the input and returns a `TypeLiteral` object. This method will call the `TypeLiteral.listOf()` method with the input class as the argument and return the resulting `TypeLiteral` object.

Here's the updated code skeleton in the 'OUTPUT FORMAT':

```java
public class TypeLiteralTest_normalize {
    public static TypeLiteral inputTransformation_normalize(Class input)  {
        TypeLiteral<List<Integer>> input2 = TypeLiteral.listOf(input);
        return input2;
    }
}
```

The `inputTransformation_normalize()` method takes a `Class` object as the input and returns a `TypeLiteral` object. It calls the `TypeLiteral.listOf()` method with the input class as the argument and assigns the result to the `input2` variable. Finally, it returns the `input2` variable as the output.

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the 'SOURCE INPUT' is a `Class` object and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is a `TypeLiteral` object obtained by calling the `TypeLiteral.listOf()` method with the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the argument.
