Based on the provided test case and input pairs, it can be observed that the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`virtualPool2`) is created by instantiating a new object of the same class (`HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool`) with the same constructor arguments as the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`virtualPool`).

Therefore, the transformation function can be created as follows:

```java
public class HybridJacksonPoolTest_testVirtualThreadPoolWithSingleThread {
    public static HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool inputTransformation_testVirtualThreadPoolWithSingleThread(HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool)  {
        HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool virtualPool2 = new HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool(virtualPool.getCapacity());
        return virtualPool2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`virtualPool`) as a parameter and creates a new object of the same class (`HybridJacksonPool.StripedLockFreePool`) with the same capacity as the 'SOURCE INPUT'. The newly created object is then returned as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`virtualPool2`).

This transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, where the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' is created by instantiating a new object of the same class with the same constructor arguments as the 'SOURCE INPUT'.
