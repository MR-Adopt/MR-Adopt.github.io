Based on the provided test case and input pairs, we can deduce the following relationship between the source input and follow-up input:

1. The `year3` value in the follow-up input is always equal to the `year1` value in the source input.
2. The `half3` value in the follow-up input is always equal to the `half2` value in the source input.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function as follows:

```java
public class TestYearHalf_test_withHalf_int {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_withHalf_int(int year1, int half1, int half2) {
        int year3 = year1;
        int half3 = half2;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year3, half3);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the `year1`, `half1`, and `half2` values as input and returns a list containing the transformed `year3` and `half3` values. The transformation function follows the deduced relationship by setting `year3` equal to `year1` and `half3` equal to `half2`.

The generated transformation function can be used to transform the source input into the follow-up input for the provided test case and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics.
