Based on the provided test case, we can deduce the relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`date`) and the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`year` and `expected`) as follows:

1. The `year` value is obtained from the `date` by extracting the year component.
2. The `expected` value is calculated based on the month value of the `date`. It is determined by dividing the month value minus 1 by 6 and adding 1.

To create the transformation function, we can use the following code:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class TestYearHalf_test_from_TemporalAccessor_notLeapYear {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_test_from_TemporalAccessor_notLeapYear(LocalDate date) {
        int year = date.getYear();
        int expected = ((date.getMonthValue() - 1) / 6) + 1;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(year, expected);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes a `LocalDate` as the 'SOURCE INPUT' and returns a list containing the transformed 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' values (`year` and `expected`). The function extracts the year from the `date` using the `getYear()` method and calculates the `expected` value based on the month value of the `date`.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' values.
