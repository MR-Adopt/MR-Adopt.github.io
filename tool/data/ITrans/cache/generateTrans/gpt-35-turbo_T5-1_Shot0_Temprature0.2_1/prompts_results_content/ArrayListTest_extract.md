The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is as follows:

1. The 'SOURCE INPUT' consists of an instance of the `IntArrayList` class named `a` and a boolean variable named `trimFlag`.
2. The 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' consists of a modified instance of the `IntArrayList` class named `a2` and a boolean variable named `trimFlag2`.
3. The modification in `a2` is performed by appending the same values as in `a` but in a different order.
4. The modification in `trimFlag2` is performed by negating the value of `trimFlag`.

Based on this relationship, we can create the transformation function `inputTransformation_extract` as follows:

```java
public class ArrayListTest_extract {
    public static List<Object> inputTransformation_extract(IntArrayList a, boolean trimFlag) {
        IntArrayList a2 = new IntArrayList();
        for (int i = a.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            a2.appendValue(a.get(i));
        }
        boolean trimFlag2 = !trimFlag;
        List<Object> transformed_inputs = Arrays.asList(a2, trimFlag2);
        return transformed_inputs;
    }
}
```

This transformation function takes the 'SOURCE INPUT' (`a` and `trimFlag`) as parameters and returns the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' (`a2` and `trimFlag2`) as a list of objects. The function creates a new instance of `IntArrayList` named `a2` and appends the values from `a` in reverse order. It also negates the value of `trimFlag` to obtain `trimFlag2`.

The transformation function can be applied to additional input pairs and other potential input pairs with similar characteristics to generate the corresponding 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
