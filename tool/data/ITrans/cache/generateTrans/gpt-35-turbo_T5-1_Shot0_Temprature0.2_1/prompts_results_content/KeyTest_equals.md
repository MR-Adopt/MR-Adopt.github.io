The deduced relationship between the 'SOURCE INPUT' and 'FOLLOW UP INPUT' in the test case is that they are always the same class. Therefore, the transformation function should simply return the 'SOURCE INPUT' as the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.

Here is the completed code skeleton for the transformation function:

```java
public class KeyTest_equals {
    public static Class<?> inputTransformation_equals(Class<?> type1)  {
        Class<?> type2 = type1;
        return type2;
    }
}
```

This transformation function can be applied to the additional input pairs and potential input pairs with similar characteristics, as they all follow the same relationship of the 'SOURCE INPUT' being equal to the 'FOLLOW UP INPUT'.
